contained in the budget is, or is based on, information you submit for your agency and programs in response to this circular. the term \"budget\" can mean other things in other contexts. it often refers to the full receipt and outlay proposals rather than the volumes in which these amounts are published. some people refer collectively to the budget resolution and revenue and spending bills that the congress passes, which we describe below, as the \"congressional budget.\" ultimately, the congress and the president enact many laws that control the government\\'s receipts and spending, which we sometimes refer to collectively as the budget, as in \"enacting the budget.\" this section provides a broad overview of the budget process. you can read more about the budget process in the section of the analytical perspectives volume of the most recent budget, \"budget concepts and budget process.\" to view or download budget documents, go to the budget website: https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/ 10.2 what is the legal requirement to prepare the budget? the budget and accounting act requires the president to submit a budget (see section 15.2). the president formally transmits his proposals for allocating resources to the congress through the budget. the congress considers the recommendations and uses the information included in the budget as it drafts and passes laws omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 1 of section 10 section 10‚Äîoverview of the budget process that affect spending and receipts. through this process the government decides how much money to spend, what to spend it on, and how to raise the money it has decided to spend. 10.3 what kinds of information does the budget provide? the budget focuses primarily on the budget year‚Äîthe upcoming fiscal year for which the congress needs to make appropriations. however, it includes data for the most recently completed year, the current year, and nine years following the budget year (outyears) in order to reflect the effect of budget decisions over the longer term. in addition to proposed appropriations for the budget year, the budget may include proposed changes to appropriations for the current year (supplementals and rescissions), and legislative proposals that would affect the current year, the budget year, or the outyears. the budget provides actual or estimated data (stated in millions or billions of dollars, depending on the context) for the following: ‚Ä¢ the amount by account that each agency may obligate the government to pay (budget authority) and estimates of payments (outlays) by agency and account; ‚Ä¢ the amount of receipts each agency collects from various sources; ‚Ä¢ budget authority, outlays, and receipts by major function of the government, such as national defense; (this is why we assign each budget account a functional classification code(s).) ‚Ä¢ total budget authority, outlays, and receipts for the government; and ‚Ä¢ the actual or estimated surplus (when receipts exceed outlays) or deficit (when outlays exceed receipts). the budget divides the government totals for budget authority, outlays, and receipts into \"on-budget\" amounts and \"off-budget\" amounts. the off-budget amounts include the transactions of the social security trust funds and the postal service, which are excluded by law from the on-budget totals. the budget arrays data in many different ways. for example, one section of the budget focuses solely on federal investment spending. also, while the budget focuses primarily on dollars, it also includes data on other resources, such as federal employment levels. 10.4 which agencies does the budget cover? the budget covers the agencies of all three branches of government‚Äîexecutive, legislative, and judicial‚Äîand provides information on government-sponsored enterprises. in accordance with law or established practice, omb includes information on agencies of the legislative branch, the judicial branch, and certain executive branch agencies as submitted by those agencies without change. by longstanding practice, the budget presents information about the board of governors of the federal reserve system but does not include amounts for the board in the budget totals, even though it is a government agency, because of the independent status of the system. the budget includes information about the government-sponsored enterprises, such as the federal national mortgage association (fannie mae), but does not include them in the budget totals because they are privately owned. (section 25 discusses the applicability of part 2 of this circular to various agencies.) the budget also includes the estimated budgetary effects of certain entities that may not report to the department of treasury. in such cases, the included activities are considered budgetary and occur because of authorities conferred or control exerted by the government. for more information on capturing the full page 2 of section 10 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 10‚Äîoverview of the budget process effect of governmental activity in the budget, see chapter 10, coverage of the budget, in the analytical perspectives volume of the budget. 10.5 what happens during the federal budget process and when? the budget process occurs in three main phases: ‚Ä¢ formulation. during this phase, the executive branch prepares the president\\'s budget. omb and the federal agencies begin preparing the next budget almost as soon as the president has sent the last one to the congress. omb officially starts the process by sending planning guidance to executive branch agencies in the spring. the president completes this phase by sending the budget to the congress on the first monday in february, as specified in law, although occasionally presidents have sent it later for various reasons. for example, in a year with a transition between outgoing and incoming administrations, the timing of the president\\'s budget transmittal changes. ‚Ä¢ congressional. this phase starts in late january or february, when the congress receives the president\\'s budget. the congress does not vote on the president\\'s budget itself, and it does not enact a budget of its own, as such. it considers the president\\'s budget proposals, passes an overall revenue and spending plan called a \"budget resolution,\" and enacts the regular appropriations acts and other laws that control spending and receipts. ‚Ä¢ execution. this phase lasts for at least five fiscal years and includes two parts. ‚Ä¢ the apportionment part pertains to funds appropriated for that fiscal year and to balances of appropriations made in prior years that remain available for obligation. at the beginning of the fiscal year, and at such other times as necessary, omb apportions funds‚Äîthat is, specifies the amount of funds that an agency may use by time period, program, project, or activity‚Äîto executive branch agencies. throughout the year, agencies hire people, enter into contracts, and enter into grant agreements, etc., in order to carry out their programs, projects, and activities. these actions use up the available funds by obligating the federal government to make outlays, immediately or in the future. ‚Ä¢ the reporting and outlay part lasts until funds are canceled (one-year and multiple-year funds are canceled at the end of the fifth year after the funds expire for new obligations) or until funds are totally disbursed (for no-year funds). note: the canceled phase of annual and multi-year authority (see section 20.4(c)) or cancellations of budgetary resources in no-year accounts pursuant to 31 u.s.c. 1555 should not be confused with cancellations as a type of reduction (see section 20.4(i)). the following tables highlight the major events in each of the phases of the budget process. these tables show the planned timing or, when applicable, the timing specified in law. the actual timing may vary from the plan. for example, the congress frequently does not enact all appropriations acts by the start of the fiscal year, and on several occasions the president has submitted the budget later than specified for various reasons, including late enactment of appropriations for the previous fiscal year or a change in administrations. since budget cycles overlap, we must begin the next cycle before completing the last one. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 3 of section 10 section 10‚Äîoverview of the budget process major steps in the formulation phase what happens? when? omb issues spring planning guidance to executive branch agencies for the upcoming budget. the omb director issues a letter to the head of each agency providing policy guidance for the agency\\'s budget request. absent more specific guidance, the outyear estimates included in the previous budget serve as a starting point for the next budget. this begins the process of formulating the budget the president will submit the following february. spring omb and the executive branch agencies discuss budget issues and options. omb spring and summer works with the agencies to: ‚Ä¢ identify major issues for the upcoming budget; ‚Ä¢ develop and analyze options for the upcoming fall review; and ‚Ä¢ plan for the analysis of issues that will need decisions in the future. omb issues circular no. a‚Äì11 to all federal agencies. this circular provides detailed june instructions for submitting budget data and materials. executive branch agencies (except those not subject to executive branch review) september* make budget submissions. see section 25. fiscal year begins. the just completed budget cycle focused on this fiscal year. it was october 1 the \"budget year\" in that cycle and is the \"current year\" in this cycle. omb conducts its fall review. omb staff analyzes agency budget proposals in light of october‚Äìnovember presidential priorities, program performance, and budget constraints. they raise issues and present options to the director and other omb policy officials for their decisions. omb opens the max a-11 data entry (max) application for all agencies to submit november their past year budget data. omb briefs the president and senior advisors on proposed budget policies. the omb late november director recommends a complete set of budget proposals to the president after omb has reviewed all agency requests and considered overall budget policies. passback. omb usually informs all executive branch agencies at the same time about late november the decisions on their budget requests. all agencies, including legislative and judicial branch agencies, enter all max late november to budget schedule data and text materials. this process continues until omb must early january * \"lock\" agencies out of the database in order to meet the printing deadline. executive branch agencies may appeal to omb and the president. an agency head december * may ask omb to reverse or modify certain decisions. in most cases, omb and the agency head resolve such issues and, if not, work together to present them to the president for a decision. agencies prepare and omb reviews congressional budget justification materials. january agencies prepare the budget justification materials they need to explain their budget requests to the responsible congressional subcommittees. president transmits the budget to the congress. first monday in february *omb provides specific deadlines for this activity. page 4 of section 10 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 10‚Äîoverview of the budget process major steps in the congressional phase what happens? when? congressional budget office (cbo) reports to budget committees on the economic and budget outlook. january cbo reestimates the president\\'s budget based on their economic and technical assumptions. february other committees submit \"views and estimates\" to house and senate budget committees. committees indicate their preferences regarding budgetary matters for which they are responsible. within 6 weeks of budget transmittal the congress completes action on the concurrent resolution on the budget. the congress commits itself to broad spending and revenue levels by passing a budget resolution. april 15 the congress needs to complete action on appropriations bills for the upcoming fiscal year or provides a \"continuing resolution\" (a stop-gap appropriation law). september 30 major steps in the execution phase what happens? when? fiscal year begins. october 1 omb apportions funds made available in the annual appropriations process and other september 10 (or available funds. agencies submit apportionment requests to omb for each budget within 30 days after account by august 21 or within 10 calendar days after the approval of the appropriation, approval of a whichever is later. omb approves or modifies the apportionment specifying the spending bill) amount of funds agencies may use by time period, program, project, or activity. agencies incur obligations and make outlays to carry out the funded programs, projects, throughout the and activities. agencies hire people, enter into contracts, and enter into grant fiscal year agreements, etc., in order to carry out their programs, projects, and activities. agencies record obligations and outlays pursuant to administrative control of funds procedures (see appendix h), report to treasury (see the treasury fiscal requirements manual and section 130), and prepare financial statements. fiscal year ends. september 30 expired phase (no-year funds do not have an expired phase). agencies disburse against until september 30, obligated balances and adjust obligated balances to reflect actual obligations during the fifth year after funds period of availability. expire. agencies continue to record obligations and outlays pursuant to administrative control of funds procedures, report to treasury, and prepare financial statements. 10.6 what is the mid-session review? the law requires the president to send a report to the congress updating budget estimates on or before july 15th. this report contains revised budget estimates resulting from changes in economic assumptions, technical reestimates, presidential initiatives, and completed congressional actions that have occurred since transmittal of the budget. your omb representative will provide guidance on the development of these estimates at the appropriate time. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 5 of section 10 section 10‚Äîoverview of the budget process 10.7 what are the central financial agencies? the central financial agencies are: ‚Ä¢ the office of management and budget (omb), in the executive office of the president; ‚Ä¢ the department of the treasury, bureau of the fiscal service (fiscal service); ‚Ä¢ the congressional budget office (cbo), in the legislative branch; and ‚Ä¢ the government accountability office (gao), in the legislative branch. 10.8 what are the responsibilities and functions of omb? omb\\'s predominant mission is to assist the president in overseeing the preparation of the president‚Äôs budget and to supervise its administration by the executive branch agencies. omb evaluates the effectiveness of agency programs, policies, and procedures, assesses competing funding demands among agencies, and sets funding priorities. omb ensures that agency reports, rules, testimony, and proposed legislation are consistent with the president\\'s budget and with administration policies. in addition, omb oversees and coordinates the administration\\'s procurement, financial management, and information and regulatory policies. in each of these areas, omb\\'s primary role is to improve administrative management, develop better performance measures and coordinating mechanisms, and reduce any unnecessary burdens on the public. for further information, refer to the omb web site. 10.9 what are the responsibilities and functions of the treasury? treasury, acting through the bureau of the fiscal service, gathers and publishes government-wide financial information that is used by the public and private sectors to monitor the government\\'s financial status and establish fiscal and monetary policies. these publications include: the daily treasury statement; the monthly treasury statement; the treasury bulletin; the combined statement; and the financial report of the u.s. government. the financial report of the u.s. government is the federal government\\'s set of audited financial statements, a requirement of the government management and reform act of 1994. for further information, refer to the fiscal service web site. 10.10 what are the responsibilities and functions of cbo? cbo was created by the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974. cbo\\'s mission is to provide the congress with the objective, timely, non-partisan analyses needed for economic and budget decisions and with the information and estimates required for the congressional budget process. cbo prepares analyses and estimates relating to the budget and the economy and presents options and alternatives for the congress to consider but does not make recommendations on policy. cbo‚Äôs services can be grouped into four categories: helping the congress formulate a budget plan; helping it stay within that plan; helping it assess the impact of federal mandates; and helping it consider issues related to the budget and economic policy. for further information, refer to the cbo web site. page 6 of section 10 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 10‚Äîoverview of the budget process 10.11 what are the responsibilities and functions of gao? gao is the investigative arm of the congress. gao helps the congress meet its constitutional responsibilities and helps improve the performance and accountability of the federal government for the american people. gao examines the use of public funds, evaluates federal programs and activities, and provides analyses, options, recommendations, and other assistance to help the congress make effective oversight, policy, and funding decisions. in this context, gao works to continuously improve the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of the federal government through financial audits, program reviews and evaluations, analyses, legal opinions, investigations, and other services. gao\\'s activities are designed to ensure the executive branch\\'s accountability to the congress under the constitution and the government\\'s accountability to the american people. gao is dedicated to good government through its commitment to the core values of accountability, integrity, and reliability. for further information, refer to the gao web site. 10.12 how do omb, cbo, the fiscal service, and gao responsibilities overlap? here are a few examples: ‚Ä¢ after omb submits the president\\'s budget, cbo is responsible for re-estimating the budget. ‚Ä¢ both omb and cbo score the costs of legislation (both appropriations and direct spending included in authorization bills). while budget committees have the ultimate responsibility for determining the scoring effects of legislation for congressional enforcement, they typically rely on cbo estimates during congressional consideration of individual bills to ensure that they are consistent with the budget resolution totals. the president uses omb estimates to determine the costs of budget-related legislation. omb reconciles or explains differences between the two sets of discretionary estimates. ‚Ä¢ omb and fiscal service work together to establish any new treasury accounts, both during the preparation of the budget and after bills become laws. ‚Ä¢ omb provides its scoring to fiscal service to assist in fiscal service‚Äôs responsibility to prepare warrants. ‚Ä¢ omb and fiscal service work together to estimate actual outlays during the course of a year. ‚Ä¢ fiscal service gathers financial information through the government-wide treasury account symbol adjusted trail balance system (gtas), that allows agencies to submit one set of accounting data (mostly budgetary, some proprietary) that fulfills the needs of the sf 133 report on budget execution and budgetary resources, the fiscal service 2108 year-end closing statement, and the prior-year column of the program and financing schedule in the president\\'s budget. ‚Ä¢ omb and fiscal service worked together to develop the gtas systems. fiscal service develops u.s. standard general ledger guidance to comply with omb definitions. ‚Ä¢ both fiscal service and gao provide guidelines used by financial managers as they account for federal finances. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 7 of section 10 section 10‚Äîoverview of the budget process ‚Ä¢ omb uses gao audits and evaluations, as well as those of agency inspectors general, as part of its review of agency programs. page 8 of section 10 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 15‚Äîbasic budget laws section 15‚Äîbasic budget laws table of contents 15.1 what laws govern the budget cycle? 15.2 why is the budget and accounting act important? 15.3 how does the congress enact the budget and how is the budget enforced? 15.4 what laws govern the budget execution process when funds are actually spent? 15.5 what does the gpra modernization act of 2010 require? 15.6 what do i need to know about the federal credit reform act of 1990? 15.1 what laws govern the budget cycle? the federal budget cycle can be divided into three distinct phases that are generally sequential and yet intertwined. the first phase, which culminates in the transmittal of the president\\'s budget proposals to the congress, is called the budget formulation phase. in the next phase, the congress acts upon laws that together constitute the enacted budget. once the laws have been enacted, executive agencies carry out the laws in the budget execution phase. the federal budget cycle is governed mainly by the following laws, which we describe below: ‚Ä¢ budget and accounting act. ‚Ä¢ congressional budget act. ‚Ä¢ balanced budget and emergency deficit control act, as amended (bbedca). ‚Ä¢ statutory pay-as-you-go act. ‚Ä¢ antideficiency act. ‚Ä¢ impoundment control act. ‚Ä¢ gpra modernization act (formerly government performance and results act). ‚Ä¢ federal credit reform act. 15.2 why is the budget and accounting act important? before enactment of this law in 1921, there was no annual centralized budgeting in the executive branch. federal government agencies usually sent budget requests independently to congressional committees with no coordination of the various requests in formulating the federal government\\'s budget. the budget and accounting act required the president to coordinate the budget requests for all government agencies and to send a comprehensive budget to the congress. it created the bureau of the budget, now the office of management and budget (omb), to help the president implement these requirements. it also required the president to include certain information in the budget. the congress has amended the requirements many times and has codified them as chapter 11, title 31, u.s. code. these are some of the requirements: ‚Ä¢ \"on or after the first monday in january but not later than the first monday in february of each year, the president shall submit a budget of the united states government for the following fiscal year.\" ‚Ä¢ \"each budget shall include a budget message and summary and supporting information. the president shall include in each budget the following....\" the provision goes on to list about thirty items, such as expenditures and receipts for the past year through the fourth year following the budget year, information on debt, financial information, and information on employment levels. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 1 of section 15 section 15‚Äîbasic budget laws ‚Ä¢ \"under regulations prescribed by the president, each agency shall provide information required by the president in carrying out this chapter. the president has access to, and may inspect, records of an agency to obtain information.\" ‚Ä¢ \"estimated expenditures and proposed appropriations for the legislative branch and the judicial branch...shall be submitted to the president before october 16 of each year and included in the budget by the president without change.\" 15.3 how does the congress enact the budget and how is the budget enforced? the congress does not enact a budget, as such. the congress reviews the president\\'s budget and develops its budget by approving three distinct kinds of measures: ‚Ä¢ the congress adopts a concurrent resolution in the spring that specifies total receipts and outlays and major categories of spending. ‚Ä¢ next, legislation authorizing changes in direct spending programs and in taxes are enacted consistent with the budget resolution. ‚Ä¢ finally, the congress enacts discretionary appropriations in the regular appropriations bills for the upcoming fiscal year. the current congressional budget process was established by the enactment of the congressional budget act (cba). before the cba, which was enacted in 1974, there was no annual centralized budgeting in the legislative branch. each of the regular annual appropriations bills was acted on separately by the congress and changes in taxes were authorized in another process. in addition, there was no established process to add up the total receipts and total spending in all the bills to reach the federal government\\'s bottom line, whether it was a surplus or a deficit. the cba established the concurrent resolution on the budget, also known as the budget resolution, the house and senate budget committees, the congressional budget office, and procedures for relating individual appropriation actions to the budget totals. also, the cba defines some key budget terms, such as budget authority, that are used in all phases of the president\\'s budget formulation process and the congressional budget process. the cba was amended extensively by a series of laws. bbedca, one of these amendments, had as its central feature a series of declining deficit targets. bbedca was amended by the budget enforcement act, which applied a statutory pay-as-you-go (paygo) process to direct spending and revenue legislation and discretionary spending limits to annual appropriations acts. the statutory paygo process and discretionary spending limits expired in 2002. recently enacted laws, however, have reinstated the statutory budget enforcement mechanisms for mandatory spending and revenues and discretionary spending. the statutory pay-as-you-go act of 2010 established a statutory procedure to enforce a rule of deficit neutrality on new revenue and mandatory spending legislation. the law requires that new legislation changing revenues or mandatory expenditures, taken cumulatively, must not increase projected deficits. if such legislation does increase projected deficits, the law requires automatic across-the-board cuts, known as sequestration, in non-exempt mandatory programs. bbedca specifies limits (\"caps\") on the amount of discretionary budget authority that can be provided through the annual appropriations process for 2012 page 2 of section 15 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 15‚Äîbasic budget laws through 2021. if the amount of appropriations provided in appropriations acts for a given year exceeds the caps, the law requires the president to cancel discretionary budgetary resources in non-exempt accounts by the excess amount. section 21 provides more information on the statutory pay-as-you-go act and bbedca and their enforcement mechanisms. 15.4 what laws govern the budget execution process when funds are actually spent? chapters 13, 15, and 33 of title 31, united states code, govern the process of budget execution. among these, the major laws are the antideficiency act, the impoundment control act, the provisions known as the economy act which are found in section 1535, the provisions that govern the closing of accounts which are found in sections 1551 through 1555, and provisions of the \"miscellaneous receipts act,\" which is found in section 3302. the antideficiency act requires omb to apportion the accounts and to monitor spending; prohibits agencies from spending more than the amounts appropriated or apportioned, whichever is lower; requires that agencies control their spending; and provides penalties for overspending. specifically, agencies may not: ‚Ä¢ purchase services and merchandise before appropriations are enacted and accounts are apportioned; ‚Ä¢ enter into contracts that exceed the appropriation for the year or the amount apportioned by omb, whichever is lower; or ‚Ä¢ pay bills when there is no cash in the appropriation or fund account. the head of each agency is required to establish, by regulation, a system of administrative control of funds that: ‚Ä¢ restricts obligation and expenditure (outlays or disbursements) from each account to the lower of the amount apportioned by omb or the amount available for obligation and/or expenditure. ‚Ä¢ enables the head of the agency to identify the person(s) responsible for violating the act. there are administrative and criminal penalties for violating the antideficiency act. also, the agency head is required to report any violations to the president, through the omb director; to the congress; and to the comptroller general. see section 145 for instructions on reporting violations. the impoundment control act, which was enacted in 1974, requires that the president notify congress whenever an official of the executive branch impounds (i.e. withholds) budget authority. there are two types of impoundments: the temporary deferral of funds and rescission proposals to permanently reduce spending. the act also prescribes the rules that must be followed whenever the executive branch impounds funds. see section 112 for instructions on reporting deferrals and rescission proposals and the rules that must be followed. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 3 of section 15 section 15‚Äîbasic budget laws 15.5 what does the gpra modernization act of 2010 require? the gpra modernization act of 2010 updates the federal government\\'s performance management framework, retaining and amplifying some aspects of the government performance and results act of 1993 (gpra) while also addressing some of its weaknesses. the gpra in 1993 had established strategic planning, performance planning, and reporting as a framework for agencies to communicate progress in achieving their missions. the gpra modernization act establishes some important changes to existing requirements that move toward a more useful approach to performance planning and reporting on a central website. the gpra modernization act serves as a foundation for helping agencies to focus on their highest priorities and creating a culture where data and empirical evidence play a greater role in policy, budget, and management decisions. a central program inventory, also required by the act, has the potential to facilitate coordination across programs by making it easier to find programs that can contribute to a shared goal, as well as improve public understanding about what federal programs do. 15.6 what do i need to know about the federal credit reform act of 1990? this law governs federal credit programs‚Äîones that make direct loans and loan guarantees. the act (fcra) prescribes a special budget treatment for direct loans and loan guarantees that measures the net present value of cash flows to and from the government, i.e., subsidy cost, rather than budgeting for credit programs on a cash basis. for most credit programs, the congress must provide budget authority equal to the subsidy cost in annual appropriations acts before the program can make direct loans or loan guarantees. section 185 of this circular addresses the requirements of this law, which was enacted as an amendment of title v of the congressional budget act of 1974. page 4 of section 15 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 20‚Äîterms and concepts section 20‚Äîterms and concepts table of contents 20.1 what is the purpose of this section?

(see section 20.4(c).) advance funding means appropriations of budget authority provided in an appropriations act to be used, if necessary, to cover obligations incurred late in the fiscal year for benefit payments in excess of the amount specifically appropriated in the act for that year, where the budget authority is charged to the appropriation for the program for the fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the appropriations act is passed. (see section 20.4(c).) agency means a department or establishment of the government for the purposes of this circular. (compare to bureau.) allowance means a lump-sum included in the budget to represent certain transactions that are expected to increase or decrease budget authority, outlays, or receipts but that are not, for various reasons, reflected in the program details. for example, the budget might include an allowance to show the effect on the budget totals of a proposal that would affect many accounts by relatively small amounts, in order to avoid unnecessary detail in the presentations for the individual accounts. the president doesn\\'t propose that congress enact an allowance as such, but rather that it modify specific legislative measures as necessary to produce the increases or decreases represented by the allowance. amendment means a proposed action that revises the president\\'s budget request and is transmitted prior to completion of action on the budget request by the appropriations committees of both houses of congress. (see section 110.2.) apportionment is a plan, approved by omb, to spend resources provided by one of the annual appropriations acts, a supplemental appropriations act, a continuing resolution, or a permanent law (mandatory appropriations). resources are apportioned by treasury appropriation fund symbol (tafs). the apportionment identifies amounts available for obligation and expenditure. it specifies and limits the obligations that may be incurred and expenditures made (or makes other limitations, as appropriate) for specified time periods, programs, activities, projects, objects, or any combination thereof. an apportioned page 2 of section 20 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 20‚Äîterms and concepts amount may be further subdivided by an agency into allotments, suballotments, and allocations. (see appendix h.) appropriated entitlement‚Äîsee entitlement. appropriation means a provision of law (not necessarily in an appropriations act) authorizing the expenditure of funds for a given purpose. usually, but not always, an appropriation provides budget authority. (see section 20.4.) appropriation account‚Äîsee treasury appropriation fund symbol. balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 (bbedca) refers to legislation that shaped the budget process, first by setting fixed targets for annual deficits and then by replacing those with a pay-as-you-go requirement for new tax or mandatory spending legislation and with caps on annual discretionary funding. most of these requirements expired in 2002. the statutory pay-as-you-go act of 2010, which did not amend bbedca, reinstated a statutory pay-as-you-go rule for revenues and mandatory spending legislation. the budget control act of 2011 (bca), which amended bbedca, reinstated discretionary caps on budget authority. (see section 21.3.) balances of budget authority means the amounts of budget authority provided in previous years that have not been outlayed. baseline means a projection of the estimated receipts, outlays, and deficit or surplus that would result from continuing current law or current policies through the period covered by the budget. (see section 80.) borrowing authority is a type of budget authority that permits obligations and outlays to be financed by borrowing. (see section 20.4(b).) budget means the budget of the united states government, which sets forth the president\\'s comprehensive financial plan and indicates the president\\'s priorities for the federal government. (see section 10.1.) budget authority (ba) means the authority provided by law to incur financial obligations that will result in outlays. the specific forms of budget authority are appropriations, borrowing authority, contract authority, and spending authority from offsetting collections. (see section 20.4.) budget control act of 2011 refers to legislation that, among other things, amended bbedca to reinstate discretionary spending limits on budget authority through 2021 and restored the process for enforcing those spending limits; increased the statutory debt ceiling; and established a joint select committee on deficit reduction that was instructed to develop a bill to reduce the federal deficit by at least $1.5 trillion over a 10-year period. it also provided a process to implement alternative spending reductions in the event that legislation achieving at least $1.2 trillion of deficit reduction was not enacted. (see section 21.3.) budget totals means the totals included in the budget for budget authority, outlays, receipts, and the surplus or the deficit. some presentations in the budget distinguish on-budget totals from off-budget totals. on- budget totals reflect the transactions of all federal government entities, except those excluded from the budget totals by law. off-budget totals reflect the transactions of government entities that are excluded from the on-budget totals by law. under current law, the off-budget totals include the social security trust funds and the postal service. the budget combines the on-and off-budget totals to derive unified (i.e. consolidated) totals for federal activity. budget year (by) refers to the fiscal year for which the budget is being considered, that is, with respect to a session of congress, the fiscal year of the government that starts on october 1 of the calendar year in which that session of congress begins. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 3 of section 20 section 20‚Äîterms and concepts budgetary resources mean amounts available to incur obligations in a given year. budgetary resources consist of new budget authority and unobligated balances of budget authority provided in previous years. bureau means the principal subordinate organizational units of an agency. cancellation means a proposal by the president to reduce budget resources (new budget authority or unobligated balances of budget authority) that is not subject to the requirements of title x of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974. resources that are proposed by the president for cancellation cannot be withheld from obligation pending congressional action on the proposal. the term is sometimes used more broadly to refer to any legislative action taken by the congress to reduce budgetary resources, including rescissions proposed by the president. cancellations can either be temporary or permanent. (see section 20.4(i).) cancellations as a type of reduction should not be confused with the canceled phase of annual and multi- year authority (see section 20.4(c)) or cancellations of budgetary resources in no-year accounts pursuant to 31 u.s.c. 1555 (see appendix f). cap means the legal limits for each fiscal year under bbedca on the budget authority and outlays (only if applicable) provided by discretionary appropriations. cap adjustment means either an increase or a decrease that is permitted to the statutory cap limits for each fiscal year under bbedca on the budget authority and outlays (only if applicable) provided by discretionary appropriations only if certain conditions are met. these conditions may include providing for a base level of funding, a designation of funds by the congress (and in some circumstances, the president), or a change in concepts and definitions of funding under the cap. changes in concepts and definitions require consultation with the congressional appropriations and budget committees. cash equivalent transaction means a transaction in which the government makes outlays or receives collections in a form other than cash or in which the outlays or receipts recorded in the budget differ from the cash because the cash does not accurately measure the value of the transaction. (see section 20.8.) chimp is an acronym for a \"change (either a cost or a savings) in a mandatory program\" that is proposed or enacted in an appropriations bill rather than in authorizing legislation. the term applies only to provisions in appropriations acts that change mandatory budget authority, outlays, offsetting collections, or offsetting receipts relative to the baseline. for the purposes of scoring those appropriations acts, such changes are scored as discretionary. after enactment, these changes are no longer considered discretionary, and they again become part of the mandatory baseline in the subsequent budget. in the max budget database, proposed chimps are separately identified with a specific budget enforcement subcategory classification known as a \"discretionary change in a mandatory program\" until they are enacted in full-year appropriations bills (see section 81.2). this classification only applies to policy estimates‚Äînot baseline estimates. under the statutory pay-as-you-go act of 2010, the outlay effects of chimps that alter mandatory budget authority in an outyear are classified as paygo (mandatory) impacts except when their net outlay effect is zero over a six-year period beginning with the current year. all changes in revenues in any year are classified as paygo, and are not scored as discretionary, even if they are included in an appropriations bill. collections mean money collected by the government that the budget records as a governmental receipt, an offsetting collection, or an offsetting receipt (see section 20.7). page 4 of section 20 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 20‚Äîterms and concepts contract authority is a type of budget authority that permits you to incur obligations in advance of an appropriation, offsetting collections, or receipts to make outlays to liquidate the obligations. typically, the congress provides contract authority in an authorizing statute to allow you to incur obligations in anticipation of the collection of receipts or offsetting collections that will be used to liquidate the obligations. (see section 20.4(b).) cost means the price or cash value of the resources used to produce a program, project, or activity. this term is used in many different contexts. when used in connection with federal credit programs, the term means the estimated long-term cost to the government of a direct loan or loan guarantee, calculated on a net present value basis, excluding administrative costs and any incidental effects on governmental receipts or outlays (see section 185). for specific instructions on estimating costs, refer to the pertinent omb instructions: for cost principles for educational institutions, see circular no. a‚Äì21; for estimating costs for user charges, see circular no. a‚Äì25; for rental and construction costs of government quarters, see circular no. a‚Äì45; for allowable costs for audits, see circular no. a‚Äì50; for cost estimates in performing commercial activities, see circular no. a‚Äì76; and for cost principles for state, local, and indian tribal governments, see circular no. a‚Äì97. the term also refers to legislation or administrative actions that increase outlays or decrease savings. credit program account means a budget account that receives and obligates appropriations to cover the subsidy cost of a direct loan or loan guarantee and disburses the subsidy amount to a financing account. (see section 185.) current services estimates‚Äîsee baseline. deferral means any executive branch action or inaction that temporarily withholds, delays, or effectively precludes the obligation or expenditure of budgetary resources. the president reports deferrals to the congress by special message. they are not identified separately in the budget. (see section 112.) deficit means the amount by which outlays exceed receipts in a fiscal year. it may refer to the on-budget, off-budget, or unified budget deficit. (see budget totals.) deposit fund means an account established to record amounts held temporarily by the government until ownership is determined (for example, earnest money paid by bidders for mineral leases) or held by the government as an agent for others (for example, state and local income taxes withheld from federal employees\\' salaries and not yet paid to the state or local government). (see section 20.11.) direct loan means a disbursement of funds by the government to a non-federal borrower under a contract that requires the repayment of such funds with or without interest. the term also includes certain equivalent transactions that extend credit. (see section 185.) (compare to loan guarantee.) direct spending‚Äîsee mandatory spending. disaster funding means a discretionary appropriation that is enacted that the congress designates as being for disaster relief. such an appropriation results in a cap adjustment to the limits on discretionary spending under bbedca. the total adjustment for this purpose cannot exceed a ceiling for a particular year that is defined as the total of the average funding provided for disaster relief over the previous 10 years (excluding the highest and lowest years) and the unused amount of the prior year\\'s ceiling (excluding the portion of the prior year\\'s ceiling that was itself due to any unused amount from the year before). disaster relief is defined as activities carried out pursuant to a determination under section 102(2) of the robert t. stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act. discretionary spending means budgetary resources (except those provided to fund mandatory spending programs) provided in appropriations acts. (see section 21.3.) (compare to mandatory spending.) omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 5 of section 20 section 20‚Äîterms and concepts where obligation limitations set in appropriations acts limit permanent budget authority, except trust fund accounts in the department of transportation, we define the budget authority for the account as discretionary in an amount equal to the limit. for the transportation trust funds, the budget authority remains mandatory, although the funds\\' outlays are discretionary. emergency requirement means an amount that the congress has designated as an emergency requirement in statute and, for discretionary appropriations, designated on an account by account basis. such amounts are not included in the estimated budgetary effects of paygo legislation under the requirements of the statutory pay-as-you-go act of 2010, if they are mandatory or receipts. such a discretionary appropriation that is subsequently designated by the president as an emergency requirement results in a cap adjustment to the limits on discretionary spending under bbedca. entitlement refers to a program in which the federal government is legally obligated to make payments or provide aid to any person who, or state or local government that, meets the legal criteria for eligibility. entitlements are generally provided by an authorizing statute, and can include loan and grant programs. examples include benefit payments for social security, medicare, medicaid, and unemployment insurance, as well as grants to states for chip and tanf. some programs, such as veteran\\'s compensation, medicaid, ssi, and child nutrition, are entitlements even though they are funded by appropriations acts because the authorizing statutes for the programs unconditionally obligate the united states to make payments. these are referred to as appropriated entitlements. (see mandatory spending, section 21.3.) expenditure transfer‚Äîsee transfers. federal funds group refers to the moneys collected and spent by the government through accounts other than those designated as trust funds. federal funds include general, special, public enterprise, and intragovernmental funds. (see section 20.11.) (compare to trust funds group.) financing account means a non-budgetary account (an account whose transactions are excluded from the budget totals) that records all of the cash flows resulting from post-1991direct loan obligations or loan guarantee commitments. at least one financing account is associated with each credit program account. for programs that make both direct loans and loan guarantees, separate financing accounts are required for direct loan cash flows and for loan guarantee cash flows. (see section 185.) (compare to liquidating account.) fiscal year means the government\\'s accounting period. it begins on october 1 and ends on september 30, and is designated by the calendar year in which it ends. forward funding means appropriations of budget authority that become available for obligation in the last quarter of the fiscal year for the financing of ongoing grant programs during the next fiscal year. (see section 20.4(c).) full-time equivalent (fte) employment is the basic measure of the levels of employment used in the budget. it is the total number of hours worked (or to be worked) divided by the number of compensable hours applicable to each fiscal year. (see section 85.) functional classification means the array of budget authority, outlays, and other budget data according to the major purpose served‚Äîfor example, agriculture, national defense, and transportation. (see section 79.3.) general fund means the accounts for collections not earmarked by law for a specific purpose, the proceeds of general borrowing, and the expenditure of these moneys. it is part of the federal funds group. page 6 of section 20 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 20‚Äîterms and concepts government sponsored enterprises (gses) mean private enterprises that were established and chartered by the federal government for public policy purposes. they are classified as non-budgetary and not included in the federal budget because they are private companies, and their securities are not backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government. however, the budget presents statements of financial condition for certain government sponsored enterprises such as the federal national mortgage association. (compare to off-budget.) governmental receipts mean collections that result from the government\\'s exercise of its sovereign power to tax or otherwise compel payment. they are compared to outlays in calculating a surplus or deficit. receipts and revenues are common terms used in place of governmental receipts. (see section 20.7.) (compare to offsetting collections and offsetting receipts.) gtas means the governmentwide treasury account symbol adjusted trial balance system. agency staff uses this system to electronically submit the accounting data that: (a) support the sf 133 report on budget execution and budgetary resources, and (b) are used for much of the initial set of past year data in max schedule p. (see sections 82.15 and 130.2). this system replaced the treasury federal agencies\\' centralized trial balance system ii (facts ii). impoundment means any executive action or inaction that temporarily or permanently withholds, delays, or precludes the obligation or expenditure of budgetary resources. intragovernmental fund‚Äîsee revolving fund. liquidating account means a budget account that records all cash flows to and from the government resulting from pre-1992 direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments. unlike financing accounts, these accounts are included in the budget totals. (see section 185.) (compare to financing account.) loan guarantee means any guarantee, insurance, or other pledge with respect to the payment of all or a part of the principal or interest on any debt obligation of a non-federal borrower to a non-federal lender. the term does not include the insurance of deposits, shares, or other withdrawable accounts in financial institutions. (see section 185.) (compare to direct loan.) mandatory appropriation‚Äîsee entitlement authority. mandatory spending means spending controlled by laws other than appropriations acts (including spending for entitlement programs) and spending for the food stamp program. although the statutory pay- as-you-go act of 2010 uses the term direct spending to mean this, mandatory spending is commonly used instead. (see section 21.3.) (compare to discretionary spending.) means of financing refers to borrowing, the change in cash balances, and certain other transactions that are involved in financing a deficit. the term is also used to refer to the debt repayment, the change in cash balances, and certain other transactions involved in using a surplus. by definition, the means of financing are not treated as receipts or outlays and so are non-budgetary. (see section 20.7(h).) nonbudgetary transactions means transactions of the government that do not belong in the budget because they do not represent net budget authority or outlays, but rather are a means of financing (such as deposit funds, direct loan and loan guarantee financing accounts, and seigniorage). (compare to off-budget and means of financing.) non-expenditure transfer‚Äîsee transfer. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 7 of section 20 section 20‚Äîterms and concepts obligated balance means the cumulative amount of budget authority that has been obligated but not yet outlayed. as prescribed by 31 u.s.c. 1551, it is the amount of unliquidated obligations in an account less the amounts collectible as repayments to the account. in other words, it is unpaid obligations net of uncollected customer payments from federal sources. (see section 20.4(g).) obligation means a binding agreement that will result in outlays, immediately or in the future. budgetary resources must be available before obligations can be incurred legally. (see section 20.5.) obligation limitation means a type of budgetary resource appropriated to accounts in a manner similar to budget authority that limits the amount of contract authority already made available for obligation by another law. the obligation limitation is effectively the amount of new budget authority available for obligation for that period. obligation limitations are used in certain transportation programs. off-budget refers to transactions of the federal government that would be treated as budgetary had congress not designated them by statute as \"off-budget.\" currently, transactions of the social security trust funds and the postal service are the only sets of transactions that are so designated. the term is sometimes used more broadly to refer to the transactions of private enterprises that were established and sponsored by the government, most especially \"government sponsored enterprises\" such as the federal home loan banks. (compare to on-budget.) offsetting collections mean payments to the government that, by law, are credited directly to expenditure accounts and deducted from gross budget authority and outlays of the expenditure account, rather than added to receipts. usually, they are authorized to be spent for the purposes of the account without further action by congress. they usually result from business-like transactions with the public, including payments from the public in exchange for goods and services, reimbursements for damages, and gifts or donations of money to the government and from intragovernmental transactions with other government accounts. the authority to spend offsetting collections is a form of budget authority. (see sections 20.4(b) and 20.7.) (compare to governmental receipts and offsetting receipts.) offsetting receipts mean payments to the government that are credited to offsetting receipt accounts and deducted from gross budget authority and outlays, rather than added to receipts. usually they are deducted at the level of the agency and subfunction, but in some cases they are deducted at the level of the government as a whole. they are not authorized to be credited to expenditure accounts. the legislation that authorizes the offsetting receipts may earmark them for a specific purpose and either appropriate them for expenditure for that purpose or require them to be appropriated in annual appropriations acts before they can be spent. like offsetting collections, they usually result from business-like transactions with the public, including payments from the public in exchange for goods and services, reimbursements for damages, and gifts or donations of money to the government, and from intragovernmental transactions with other government accounts. (see section 20.7.) (compare to governmental receipts and offsetting collections.) on-budget refers to all budgetary transactions other than those designated as off-budget. (compare to off- budget.) outlay means a payment to liquidate an obligation (other than the repayment of debt principal or other disbursements that are \"means of financing\" transactions). outlays generally are equal to cash disbursements but also are recorded for cash-equivalent transactions, such as the issuance of debentures to pay insurance claims, and in a few cases are recorded on an accrual basis such as interest on public issues of the public debt. outlays are the measure of government spending. (see section 20.6.) outyear estimates mean estimates presented in the budget for the years beyond the budget year of budget authority, outlays, receipts, and other items (such as debt). page 8 of section 20 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 20‚Äîterms and concepts overseas contingency operations/global war on terrorism (oco/gwot) means a discretionary appropriation that is enacted that the congress and, subsequently, the president have so designated on an account by account basis. such a discretionary appropriation that is designated as oco/gwot results in a cap adjustment to the limits on discretionary spending under bbedca. funding for these purposes has most recently been associated with the wars in iraq and afghanistan. pay-as-you-go (paygo) refers to the requirements of the statutory pay-as-you-go act of 2010 that result in a sequestration if the estimated combined result of new legislation affecting direct spending or revenue increases the on-budget deficit relative to the baseline, as of the end of a congressional session. (see section 21.3.) public enterprise fund‚Äîsee revolving fund. reappropriation means an extension of the availability of unobligated balances of budget authority that have expired or would otherwise expire as a result of legislation enacted subsequent to the law that provided the budget authority. (see section 20.4(h), section 120.66.) receipts‚Äîsee governmental receipts or offsetting receipts. reduction in budgetary resources means a rescission (see section 20.4(i)); cancellation (see section 20.4(i)); across-the-board reduction; or sequestration (see section 100). refund means the return of excess payments to or by the government. (see section 20.9.) reimbursable obligation means an obligation financed by offsetting collections credited to an expenditure account in payment for goods and services provided by that account. (see section 83.5.) rescission means a proposal by the president to reduce budgetary resources (new budget authority or unobligated balances of budget authority) pursuant to the requirements of title x of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974. resources that are proposed by the president for rescission may be withheld from obligation for 45 calendar days of continuous session of the congress (excluding an adjournment of more than three days on which either house is not in session) pending congressional action on the proposal. the term is often used more broadly to refer to any legislative action taken by the congress to reduce budgetary resources, including reductions that were not proposed pursuant to the impoundment control act. rescissions can either be temporary or permanent. (see section 20.4(i).) revolving fund means a fund that conducts continuing cycles of business-like activity, in which the fund charges for the sale of products or services and uses the proceeds to finance its spending, usually without requirement for annual appropriations. there are three types of revolving funds: public enterprise funds, which conduct business-like operations mainly with the public, intragovernmental revolving funds, which conduct business-like operations mainly within and between government agencies, and trust revolving funds, which conduct business-like operations mainly with the public and are designated by law as a trust fund. (see section 20.11) scorekeeping means measuring the budget effects of legislation in terms of budget authority, governmental receipts, and outlays, for purposes of measuring adherence to the president\\'s budget, other budget targets, or budget enforcement laws. (see section 21.) sequestration means the cancellation of budgetary resources. the statutory pay-as-you-go act of 2010 requires such cancellations if revenue or direct spending legislation is enacted that, in total, increases projected deficits or reduces projected surpluses relative to the baseline. bbedca requires annual acrossthe- board cancellations to selected mandatory programs through 2025 and would require cancellations if discretionary appropriations exceed the statutory limits on discretionary spending. (see section 100.) omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 9 of section 20 section 20‚Äîterms and concepts special fund means a federal fund account for receipts earmarked for specific purposes and the expenditure of these receipts. (see section 20.11.) spending authority from offsetting collections is a type of budget authority that permits obligations and outlays to be financed by offsetting collections (see section 20.4(b)). (compare to offsetting collections.) statutory pay-as-you-go act of 2010 refers to legislation that reinstated a statutory pay-as-you-go requirement for new tax or mandatory spending legislation. the law is a stand-alone piece of legislation that cross-references bbedca but does not directly amend that legislation. subsidy means the estimated long-term cost to the government of a direct loan or loan guarantee, calculated on a net present value basis, excluding administrative costs and any incidental effects on governmental receipts or outlays. (see section 185.) supplemental appropriation means an appropriation enacted subsequent to a regular annual appropriations act, when the need for funds is too urgent to be postponed until the next regular annual appropriations act. (see section 110.2.) surplus means the amount by which receipts exceed outlays in a fiscal year. it may refer to the on-budget, off-budget, or unified budget surplus. (see budget totals.) third scorecard is sometimes used to refer to the effects of a mandatory or revenue proposal that are not subject to paygo (see sections 79.2 and 81.2 for more information on reporting these effects in max.) these non-paygo effects may include: ‚Ä¢ the paygo-exempt portions of mandatory or revenue proposals that require authorizing legislation, such as off-budget or emergency legislation; ‚Ä¢ the indirect effect of mandatory or revenue proposals, including proposals that require authorizing legislation, which are not subject to paygo. indirect effects include the effects on interest; ‚Ä¢ the mandatory or revenue savings or costs that result from discretionary policies, such as the savings associated with an increased level of anti-fraud or enhanced compliance effort achieved by additional administrative or program management funding. transfer means to move budgetary resources from one budget account to another. depending on the circumstances, the budget may record a transfer as an expenditure transfer, which means a transfer that involves an outlay, or as a nonexpenditure transfer, which means a transfer that doesn\\'t involve an outlay. (see section 20.4(j).) transfer in the estimates means a proposal to stop funding an activity through one budget account and begin funding it through another account. a transfer in the estimates doesn\\'t involve a transfer of budgetary resources between the accounts. (see section 20.4(k).) treasury account symbol (tas) refers to the account identification codes assigned by the department of the treasury to individual appropriation, receipt, or other fund accounts. all financial transactions of the federal government are classified by tas for reporting to the department of the treasury and the office of management and budget. tas includes all the component pieces of treasury appropriation fund symbol plus any sub-accounts established by treasury. treasury appropriation fund symbol (tafs) refers to the separate treasury accounts for each appropriation title based on the availability of the resources in the account. the tafs is a combination of page 10 of section 20 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 20‚Äîterms and concepts federal agency; allocation agency, when applicable; account symbol; and availability code (e.g., annual, multi-year, or no-year). (see section 20.4(c)). trust fund refers to a type of account, designated by law as a trust fund, for receipts or offsetting receipts dedicated to specific purposes and the expenditure of these receipts. some revolving funds are designated as trust funds, and these are called trust revolving funds. trust revolving funds have no receipt account and the collections are credited directly to the expenditure account. (see section 20.11.) (compare to special funds and revolving funds.) trust funds group refers to the moneys collected and spent by the government through trust fund accounts. (see section 20.11.) (compare to federal funds group.) unexpended balance means the sum of the unobligated and obligated balances. unobligated balance means the cumulative amount of budget authority that remains available for obligation under law in unexpired accounts. the term \"expired balances available for adjustment only\" refers to unobligated amounts in expired accounts. (see section 20.4(f).) user charges are charges assessed for the provision of government services and for the sale or use of government goods or resources. the payers of the user charge must be limited in the authorizing legislation to those receiving special benefits from, or subject to regulation by, the program or activity beyond the benefits received by the general public or broad segments of the public (such as those who pay income taxes or customs duties). user charges are defined and the policy regarding user charges is established in omb circular a‚Äì25, \"user charges\" (july 8, 1993). the term encompasses proceeds from the sale or use of government goods and services, including the sale of natural resources (such as timber, oil, and minerals) and proceeds from asset sales (such as property, plant, and equipment). (see section 20.7(g).) warrant means an official document issued by the secretary of the treasury, pursuant to law, that establishes the amount of appropriations approved by the congress that can be obligated and disbursed. 20.4 what do i need to know about budget authority? (a) definition of budget authority budget authority (ba) means the authority provided by law to incur financial obligations that will result in outlays. this definition is the same as the one contained in section 3(2) of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974, which the congress uses in the congressional budget process. you violate the law if you enter into contracts, issue purchase orders, hire employees, or otherwise obligate the government to make a payment before a law has provided budget authority for that purpose (see section 145.1). (b) forms of budget authority most laws provide budget authority in the form of appropriations, but some laws provide budget authority in the form of contract authority, borrowing authority, or spending authority from offsetting collections. the following table summarizes the characteristics of each form of budget authority, and the text following the table discusses them in more depth. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 11 of section 20 section 20‚Äîterms and concepts forms of budget authority form of budget authority summary of characteristics appropriation ‚Ä¢ authorizes obligations and outlays using general funds, special funds, or trust funds. ‚Ä¢ provided in appropriations acts and other laws. ‚Ä¢ may authorize the use of cash-equivalent payments. ‚Ä¢ not all appropriations provide budget authority. contract authority ‚Ä¢ authorizes obligations but not outlays. ‚Ä¢ typically provided in authorizing laws with variations in the way obligations are liquidated. borrowing authority ‚Ä¢ authorizes obligations with outlays to be financed by borrowing, usually from treasury. ‚Ä¢ typically provided in laws that authorize business-like operations and require the borrowing to be repaid, with interest, out of the business proceeds. spending authority from offsetting collections ‚Ä¢ authorizes obligations and outlays using offsetting collections. ‚Ä¢ typically provided in authorizing laws. ‚Ä¢ appropriations acts limit obligations in some cases. ‚Ä¢ budget authority may be recorded and obligations incurred against orders from other federal accounts only if an obligation is recorded by the paying account; obligations normally cannot be incurred against orders from the public without an advance. (1) appropriations, as a type of budget authority, permit you to incur obligations and make outlays (payments). (not all appropriations provide budget authority, as explained below.) the congress enacts appropriations in annual appropriations acts and other laws. an appropriation may make funds available from the general fund, special funds, or trust funds. an appropriations act may also authorize the spending of offsetting collections, which are credited to expenditure accounts (including revolving funds) (see spending authority from offsetting collections below). a law that authorizes you to incur obligations and liquidate them through cash-equivalent payments (see section 20.8) constitutes an appropriation of budget authority. some appropriations are not recorded as new budget authority because they relate to obligations that have already been legally incurred and do not provide the authority to incur new obligations. amounts appropriated to liquidate contract authority provide the cash needed to liquidate obligations incurred against contract authority in advance of collections or an appropriation to liquidate; amounts appropriated to liquidate debt provide the cash needed to repay money borrowed from treasury to liquidate obligations incurred against borrowing authority. page 12 of section 20 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 20‚Äîterms and concepts in contrast, deficiency appropriations, which allow agencies to liquidate obligations that were incurred in a prior fiscal year without sufficient budget authority to legally cover such obligations, are recorded as new budget authority but deducted from the total budgetary resources available for obligation. deficiency appropriations reduce or eliminate the negative balance that results from obligating amounts in excess of an account\\'s budgetary resources (see section 82.18 and appendix f). this treatment helps ensure that any obligations that were incurred without sufficient budget authority, particularly in cases where the obligation has yet to be liquidated, are still recognized in the budget authority totals as a current cost. if these costs are not recognized as new budget authority, then the total budget authority available to enter into new obligations in a given fiscal year will have effectively been allowed to increase without scoring the impact of that increase. see section 145.10 for guidance on when to request a deficiency appropriation. for purposes of the antideficiency act, the definition of the term \"appropriations\" is broader. as defined by the act, it means all new budget authority and balances of budget authority as described here. (2) contract authority permits you to incur obligations in advance of an appropriation, offsetting collections, or receipts that enable you to make outlays to liquidate the obligations. typically, the congress provides contract authority in an authorizing statute to allow you to incur obligations in anticipation of the collection of receipts or offsetting collections that will be used to liquidate the obligations. when you receive the appropriated receipts or the collections, you replace the contract authority with the appropriation or the spending authority from the offsetting collections to cover the obligations and subsequently liquidate the obligations. for some programs, the law authorizes you to use offsetting collections to liquidate the obligations incurred against the contract authority without further appropriation action. in a few cases, such as the foreign military sales program, the law that provides the contract authority also appropriates the receipts without further appropriation action. for other programs, such as certain highway and airport and airway programs, the congress as a matter of custom requires you to seek an appropriation of receipts to liquidate the obligations. in some instances, if the program does not have sufficient collections to liquidate the obligations incurred against contract authority, the congress may enact a general fund appropriation. (3) borrowing authority permits you to incur obligations and authorizes you to borrow funds to liquidate the obligations. usually, the law authorizing the borrowing specifies that you must borrow from the treasury, but in a few cases it authorizes borrowing directly from the public. laws usually authorize borrowing for business-like operations, such as the tennessee valley authority, which generates and sells electrical power. such laws require the program to repay the borrowing, with interest, out of business proceeds. (4) spending authority from offsetting collections, usually provided in permanent law, permits you to credit offsetting collections to an expenditure account (see section 20.7(d)), to incur obligations, and to make payments using the offsetting collections. you record spending authority from offsetting collections and the offsetting collections in the program and financing schedule of an account (see section 82.18). in the simplest case, you record gross budget authority equal to the cash collections for the year (lines 1700 and 1800) and record the cash collections as an offset to the budget authority (lines 4030-4034 and 4120-4124). net budget authority equals zero in such cases. in other cases, you must adjust spending authority from cash collections to yield the amount available as budget authority. we describe these adjustments in section 82.18 (lines 1701-1728 and 1801-1827). we discuss some of these adjustments (offsetting collections credited to expired accounts, changes in uncollected customer payments from federal sources, and amounts precluded from obligation)‚Äîin more detail below. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 13 of section 20 section 20‚Äîterms and concepts offsetting collections credited to expired accounts. for annual and multi-year accounts that perform reimbursable work, the spending authority from the offsetting collections belongs to the treasury account that filled the order. (see section 20.11 for the distinction between treasury accounts (tafs) and budget accounts.) the availability of the spending authority is generally the same as the treasury account to which it belongs. if the annual or multi-year treasury account has expired, then you should not record the collection as new spending authority (schedule p lines 1700 and 1800) because it is not available to incur new obligations. it is not new budget authority. however, collections that belong to expired treasury accounts are available to pay old bills, until the authority is canceled. you record collections in expired accounts as offsetting collections along with the collections in unexpired accounts (schedule p lines 40304034 and 4120-4124). you report the portion credited to expired accounts only on schedule p lines 4052 or 4142. for more information on determining the period of availability of budget authority, see section 20.4(c). as discussed in section 20.11, each budget account covers all the treasury accounts with the same appropriation title. the program and financing schedule covers: ‚Ä¢ unexpired accounts (annual, multi-year and no-year); and ‚Ä¢ expired accounts. you subtract all offsetting collections (unexpired and expired) from gross outlays to yield net outlays so that the contribution of the budget account to the federal government\\'s bottom line (the surplus or deficit) can be determined. for no-year accounts, you record gross new budget authority (spending authority from offsetting collections) equal to the collections for the year and record the collections as an offset to the budget authority. because offsetting collections and offsetting receipts are deducted from gross budget authority, they are referred to as negative budget authority for some purposes, such as congressional budget act provisions that pertain to budget authority. amounts precluded from obligation. a law may preclude you from using some of the offsetting collections to incur obligations. in these cases, the precluded amounts are not counted as budget authority. however, you always deduct the full amount of offsetting collections (cash) from gross budget authority and gross outlays in the year you collect them, even where a law precludes you from obligating all or a portion of the collections in that year. for this reason, an account can have negative net budget authority or outlays. as a general rule, you record obligations first against new offsetting collections. to the extent that the new offsetting collections are not adequate to cover obligations, you record new budget authority from previously unavailable balances of offsetting collections, but you may not exceed the new obligation limitation, if any. changes in uncollected customer payments from federal sources. you need to adjust the spending authority from cash collections if the account is authorized to perform reimbursable work for another federal account and you incur obligations against receivables from federal sources and unfilled customer orders from federal sources without an advance‚Äîthat is, before receiving the cash. the law allows you to incur such obligations as long as the paying account is a federal account and an obligation is recorded against resources available to the paying account. for example, a financing account can obligate against a subsidy accounts receivable from the program account before the cash is received from the program account if the program account has recorded an obligation in the form of a subsidy accounts payable to the financing account. (you cannot incur obligations against customer orders received from non-federal sources without an advance, unless a law specifically allows it.) page 14 of section 20 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 20‚Äîterms and concepts in these cases, you must add any net increase in such amounts for the year to the spending authority from cash collections, or subtract any net decrease in such amounts for the year from the spending authority from cash collections, to yield the gross budget authority available to the account from offsetting collections. you also add (or subtract) the same amount to offsetting collections (cash) to yield the amount of the offset applied to gross budget authority when calculating net budget authority (see section 82.18). when program levels remain relatively stable, the amount of reimbursements from other federal government accounts that is earned but not collected should remain relatively stable and any changes in uncollected customer payments from federal sources should net to zero. therefore, unless an account is projecting significant increases or decreases in program level, there should be no outyear estimates of changes in uncollected customer payments. (c) period of availability of budget authority when a law appropriates budget authority, it sets the period during which you can use it to incur new obligations. we call this the period of availability for new obligations of the budget authority, and the period normally is specified in the law providing the budget authority. the period of availability for incurring new obligations is shorter than the period of availability for making disbursements, which is covered by a general law. each is described below. period of availability for incurring new obligations: ‚Ä¢ annual budget authority. this term refers to budget authority that is available for obligation during only one fiscal year or less. one year is the default period of availability for annual appropriations acts (including an appropriation that provides indefinite authority such as \"such sums as may be necessary‚Ä¶\"), because a general provision in each of the acts specifies that the amounts provided in the act are available for one year, unless the act expressly provides otherwise. even if there were not such a provision, the preamble of an appropriations act says that it is for a specific fiscal year. for example, the following language in an appropriation act would provide one-year budget authority: \"for expenses of the office of the secretary, $1,500,000.\" ‚Ä¢ multi-year budget authority. the language for a specific appropriation of budget authority in an appropriations act or the authorization of the appropriation may make all or some portion of the amount available for obligation for a specified period of time in excess of one fiscal year. usually, the period covers two or more whole fiscal years, but it may cover a period that includes part of the second fiscal year. we refer to such budget authority as multi-year budget authority or, specifically, as two-year budget authority, three-year budget authority, etc. for example, if the following language appeared in an appropriations act for 2011, it would provide two-year budget authority: \"for research and development, $1,500,000, to remain available until september 30, 2012.\" ‚Ä¢ no-year budget authority. the language for a specific appropriation of budget authority or the authorization of the appropriation may make all or some portion of the amount available until expended. that means you can incur obligations against it indefinitely. we refer to this as no-year budget authority. for example, the following language provides no-year budget authority: \"for construction, improvements, repair or replacement of physical facilities, $1,500,000, to remain available until expended.\" authorizing laws that make appropriations seldom limit the period of availability, so most budget authority provided in authorizing laws is no-year budget authority. 31 u.s.c. 1555 provides for the closing of appropriation accounts that are available for indefinite periods if the agency head or the president determines that the purposes of the appropriation have been carried out and no disbursement has been made for two consecutive fiscal years. see appendix f for a description of line 1029, other balances withdrawn. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 15 of section 20 section 20‚Äîterms and concepts usually an appropriations act makes budget authority available beginning on october 1 of the fiscal year for which the appropriation act is passed. however, there are three types of appropriations where that is not the case. ‚Ä¢ advance appropriation, as defined by the congressional budget act of 1974 (31 u.s.c. 1105(a)(17)), means appropriations of new budget authority provided in an annual appropriations act that become available one or more fiscal years beyond the fiscal year for which the appropriation act was passed. for example, if the following language appeared in an appropriations act for fiscal year 2013, it would provide an advance appropriation for fiscal year 2014: \"for operating expenses, $1,500,000, to become available on october 1, 2013.\" the term ‚Äúadvance appropriation‚Äù applies only to discretionary funding in appropriations acts or to mandatory funding provided in appropriations acts and classified as \"appropriated entitlements\" or \"appropriated mandatories\" by the balanced budget act of 1997 (see section 21.3(c)). under current scoring guidelines, new discretionary budget authority for advance appropriations is scored in the fiscal year in which the funds become available for obligation and must be accommodated within the statutory discretionary spending caps for that year (see section 21.3 (g)). in this example, you would record the budget authority in fiscal year 2014. ‚Ä¢ advance funding means appropriations of budget authority provided in an appropriations act to be used, if necessary, to cover obligations incurred late in the fiscal year for benefit payments in excess of the amount specifically appropriated in the act for that year, where the budget authority is charged to the appropriation for the program for the fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the appropriations act is passed. when such budget authority is used, the budget records an increase in the budget authority for the fiscal year in which it is used and a reduction in the budget authority for the following fiscal year. the following language, when added to regular appropriation language, provides advance funding: \"...together with such sums as may be necessary to be charged to the subsequent year appropriation for the payment of compensation and other benefits for any period subsequent to august 15 of the current year.\" ‚Ä¢ forward funding means appropriations of budget authority that are made available for obligation in the last quarter of the fiscal year for the financing of ongoing grant program during the next fiscal year. the budget records the budget authority in the fiscal year in which it is appropriated. the following language, if it appeared in an appropriation act for 2014, would provide forward funding, which would be recorded in fiscal year 2014: \"... of which $2,000,000,000 shall become available on july 1, 2014 and shall remain available through september 30, 2015 for academic year 2014‚Äì 2015.\" period of availability for making disbursements: under a general law, annual budget authority and multi-year budget authority may disburse during the first two phases of the following three phases that make up the life cycle of the budget authority. ‚Ä¢ unexpired phase. during this time period the budget authority is available for incurring \"new\" obligations. you may make \"new\" grants or sign \"new\" contracts during this phase and you may make disbursements to liquidate the obligations. this phase lasts for a set number of years. annual budget authority lasts for up to one fiscal year. multi-year authority lasts for longer periods, currently from over one fiscal year up to 15 fiscal years, and no-year authority lasts indefinitely. ‚Ä¢ expired phase. during this time period, the budget authority is no longer available for new obligations but is still available for disbursement. this phase lasts five years after the last unexpired year unless the expiration period has been lengthened by legislation. specifically, you may not incur new obligations against expired budget authority, but you may liquidate existing obligations by making disbursements. page 16 of section 20 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 20‚Äîterms and concepts however, you may use the expired budget authority to make certain adjustments to obligations that were incurred before the budget authority expired. for example, you could make an upward adjustment in previously recorded obligations for transportation charges, under an agreement to pay actual transportation charges, if they turned out to be greater than originally estimated. unless there is an exception in law, you may use expired authority to make adjustments to obligations or disbursements only during a period of five years after the last unexpired year. the expired period can be lengthened by legislation. if you have a program with a legitimate need to disburse funds for more than five years after the authority expires for obligation‚Äîfor example, to make disbursements over many years under direct loan contracts, to pay termination costs under a contract, or to make payments under a lease‚Äîand your omb representative approves, you may propose special language to disburse over a period longer than five years (see section 95.8). you may disburse during the longer period only if the special language is enacted in law. ‚Ä¢ canceled phase. after the last expired year, the account is closed, and the balances are canceled. the authority to disburse is canceled and is no longer available for any purpose. any offsetting collections credited to the account at the time the account is canceled or subsequently must be transferred to miscellaneous receipts in the treasury. any old bills with valid obligations that show up after the account is closed must be obligated against and disbursed from budget authority that is available for the same general purpose but still in the unexpired phase. for example, an old bill from obligations incurred against an fy 2006 annual salaries and expense (s&e) account that arrives after the authority is canceled must be obligated and disbursed against the corresponding fy 2012 annual s&e account. no-year authority usually stays in the unexpired phase until fully obligated and disbursed. when the purposes for which the authority was made available have been achieved, the account may be closed and the authority canceled. (d) determining the amount of budget authority if a law provides budget authority in a specific amount, we refer to it as definite budget authority. we consider the budget authority definite when the language provides a ceiling, for example \"not to exceed\" a specified amount. you record the specified amount as budget authority. for example, this language would provide definite budget authority of $100 million: \"for salaries and expenses, not to exceed $100,000,000.\" if a law doesn\\'t specify an amount of budget authority, but, instead, specifies a variable factor that determines the amount, or a floor, for example \"not less than\" a specified amount, we refer to the budget authority as indefinite. if the law provides \"such sums as may be necessary\" to cover the obligations resulting from an entitlement (such as unemployment insurance), record budget authority in the past year equal to the amount obligated and in other years equal to your estimate of obligations. if a law authorizes you to obligate all of the receipts from a specified source, record budget authority equal to the amount of receipts you collected in the past year and equal to amounts you estimate you will collect in other years. if a law appropriates a specific amount to be derived from receipts, it limits the amount of budget authority actually provided to the lower of the actual receipts or the amount specified. for example, if the language read, \"... and, in addition, $75,000,000 of the amounts collected under section 101 of the authorization act of 2005,\" you could obligate only the amount actually collected, up to $75,000,000. similarly, if a law appropriates an amount to be derived from a special or trust fund, it limits the amount of budget authority actually provided to the lower of the amount of the balances in the fund or the specified amount. for example, language that reads, \"for necessary expenses, $1,500,000, to be derived from the land restoration trust fund,\" allows you to obligate only the amount actually in the fund and no more than $1,500,000. if a law authorizes you to obligate all of the receipts credited to a fund, record budget authority omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 17 of section 20 section 20‚Äîterms and concepts equal to the amount of receipts collected by the fund in the past year and equal to the amounts you estimate you will collect in other years. some laws that provide borrowing authority limit the amount of debt that may be outstanding at any one time. this may limit your ability to incur obligations indirectly, because you must consider your ability to borrow the cash needed to liquidate the obligations that will become due, but it doesn\\'t determine the level of obligations directly. instead, these laws act much like a revolving line of credit where you may repeatedly borrow up to a limit, make repayments, and borrow again up to the limit, so that over time your total borrowing exceeds the limit on credit outstanding at any point in time. in such cases, treat the budget authority as indefinite and record the amount that you obligated in the past year or estimate you will obligate in other years. balances of indefinite borrowing authority may not be carried forward in excess of amounts needed to cover obligations. under the scorekeeping guidelines used by omb and congressional scorekeepers, omb will score legislation that imposes or changes a limit of this type only to the extent that we estimate that it will alter the amount of obligations that will be incurred (see appendix a, scorekeeping guideline no. 16). most budget authority provided in appropriations acts is definite, and most budget authority provided in other laws is indefinite. the congress may enact laws that preclude agencies from using all of their potential budget authority. for example, in some cases the congress enacts limitations on obligations or program levels in appropriations acts that limit the authority to use offsetting collections or receipts provided in authorizing legislation. in other cases, the authorizing law may itself limit the amount of obligations you may incur, such as through a benefit formula that determines the amount of benefits that may be obligated. for special and trust funds with indefinite budget authority whose obligations are constrained by a limitation on obligations or benefit formula, the collections in excess of such limitations or benefit formulas are not counted as budget authority. similarly, offsetting collections that are precluded from obligation are not counted as budget authority. in these cases, you reduce the spending authority by the precluded amount. the precluded amounts are considered to be unavailable and are not included in the account\\'s unobligated balances. you record new budget authority in the year the amounts become available for obligation under the law. (e) discretionary or mandatory and current or permanent budget authority bbedca requires us to classify budget authority (and outlays) as either discretionary spending or mandatory spending, and applies a different set of rules to each type of spending. we explain this further in section 21.3. sometimes, budget authority is characterized as current or permanent. current authority requires congressional appropriations action on the request for new budget authority for the year involved. permanent authority becomes available pursuant to standing provisions of law without further appropriations action by the congress after transmittal of the budget for the year involved. generally, budget authority is current if an annual appropriations act provided it and permanent if authorizing legislation provides it. by and large, the current/permanent distinction has been replaced by the discretionary/mandatory distinction, which is similar but not identical. (f) unobligated balance an unobligated balance consists of the cumulative amount of budget authority that remains available for obligation under law in unexpired accounts. this means that, unless the law expressly provides otherwise, rescissions and cancellations of unobligated balances apply only to unexpired amounts. in cases where page 18 of section 20 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 20‚Äîterms and concepts rescissions or cancellations are determined to apply to expired amounts, such amounts would not count as discretionary offsets for appropriations. in budget execution, both the unexpired, unobligated balances of budget authority at the start of the year, (which is available for new obligations) and the expired amounts (which are only available to cover upward adjustments to prior year obligations) are reported as budgetary resources. in budget formulation, only the unexpired, unobligated balances brought forward are reported; expired balances available for adjustment only are not included. unobligated balances carried forward must meet all of the following conditions: ‚Ä¢ they are balances of budget authority that have never been obligated or that have been obligated and deobligated; ‚Ä¢ they are balances of budget authority that do not expire at the end of the fiscal year; ‚Ä¢ they do not include any amounts for: (1) indefinite appropriations, except available special and trust fund receipts; (2) indefinite borrowing authority; or (3) indefinite contract authority; and ‚Ä¢ the amount can be quantified by subtracting the obligations to date from the amount of budget authority provided (new budget authority and unobligated balances carried forward at the start of the year from the previous fiscal year). that is, the law providing the budget authority must have specified a definite amount or an indefinite amount based on the appropriation of collections from a specified source. \"such sums as may be necessary\" cannot be quantified. unavailable special and trust fund receipts or unavailable offsetting collections should not be counted as budget authority and, therefore, there should be no unobligated balances as a result of them. unavailable receipts are included in the special and trust fund receipts schedule (see section 86.4); unavailable offsetting collections are presented as a memorandum entry in the program and financing schedule (see section 82.18). in budget schedules, such as the program and financing schedule, the unobligated balance carried forward at the end of a year is equal to the unobligated balance at the start of the next year. the unobligated balances you report for the start and end of the past year must be consistent with the amounts reported in gtas (see sections 82.11 and 82.12). (g) obligated balance the term obligated balance is a term of art that is defined in law as a \"net\" concept. it is not the unpaid obligations. the obligated balances are calculated as follows: ‚Ä¢ take the unpaid obligations (which is the sum of the accounts payable and the undelivered orders); and ‚Ä¢ subtract the uncollected customer payments from federal sources (i.e., accounts receivable and the unpaid, unfilled orders from federal sources). (h) reappropriation a reappropriation is an extension of the availability of unobligated balances of budget authority that have expired or would otherwise expire as a result of legislation enacted subsequent to the law that provided the budget authority. the term does not apply to extensions of the availability of unobligated balances of budget authority that result from standing provisions of law, enacted before the budget authority was provided, or from provisions of law included in the same law that appropriated the funds. an example of an extension included in the same law that appropriated the funds is section 511 of the treasury and general omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 19 of section 20 section 20‚Äîterms and concepts government appropriations act, 2003, which allows agencies to extend the period of availability (expired to unexpired) of unobligated balances of appropriations (annual or multi-year) provided in the same act. the act states: \"... not to exceed 50 percent of unobligated balances remaining available at the end of fiscal year 2002 from appropriations made available for salaries and expenses for fiscal year 2002 in this act, shall remain available through september 30, 2003, ...\" reappropriations of expired balances that are newly available for obligation in the current or budget year will be recorded as new budget authority (reappropriations) in the year they are newly available, in the full amount of the potential extension. likewise, reappropriations of amounts that would expire before the legislation takes affect (e.g., a reappropriation of funds that would expire at the end of fy 2014 included in an fy 2015 appropriations act enacted in august, 2014) would be treated as new budget authority (reappropriations). an example of this type of extension is found in section 137 (division f) of the consolidated appropriations act, 2003, which states: \"‚Ä¶.the funds provided in labor, health and human services, education and related agencies appropriations act of 2002, public law 107‚Äì116, for the national museum of african american history and culture plan for action presidential commission shall remain available until expended.\" in this example the fy 2002 appropriated funds were annual and therefore would have expired at the end of september 30, 2002. the language in the fy 2003 appropriation reappropriated the expired funds to unexpired no-year funds. reappropriations of unexpired balances or reappropriations of expired balances that cannot take effect until a fiscal year beyond the budget year will be reported as balance transfers in the year they are newly available for obligation. similar to reappropriations of unexpired balances, extensions in availability resulting from standing provisions of law or from provisions of law included in the same law that appropriated the funds will be shown as balance transfers. see section 120.66 for a complete discussion on reporting for all types of extensions in availability. (i) rescissions and cancellations rescissions and cancellations are reductions in law of budgetary resources. reductions are recorded as negative budget authority in the year the reduction takes effect, regardless of whether the action reduces new budget authority or unobligated balances. if a law that precludes the obligation of budgetary resources in one year and authorizes their obligation in a subsequent year, you record negative budget authority in year of the reduction and new budget authority in the subsequent year. proposed cancellations and all enacted reductions should be included in the regular budget schedules under transmittal code 0 (see section 79.2). proposed rescissions, which are subject to the requirements of title 10 of the congressional budget and impoundment control act, require separate schedules under transmittal code 5 (see section 112). the congress can enact reductions in many ways. for example, the language can specify a dollar or percentage reduction and can pertain to a specific account or multiple accounts. sequestration is also cancellation of budgetary resources (see section 100 for complete guidance on sequestration). rescissions and cancellations can impact all types of budget authority and can be permanent or temporary subject to the underlying availability of the funds and to the specific statutory authority for the reduction. page 20 of section 20 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 20‚Äîterms and concepts rescissions and cancellations of general fund appropriations are considered to be permanent reductions unless the legislation clearly indicates that the reduction is temporary. permanent reductions of general fund appropriations revert to the general fund of the u.s. treasury. reductions of contract authority and borrowing authority are also usually permanent. rescissions and cancellations of amounts appropriated from special and trust fund receipts, as well as spending authority from offsetting collections from non-federal sources, are usually temporary reductions. for rescissions and cancellations of spending authority from offsetting collections from federal sources, the original source of the funding needs to be considered to determine whether the reduction is temporary or permanent. the reduction amounts are reported as balances of unappropriated receipts (see section 86.4) or as unavailable offsetting collections (see section 82.18). if the reduced amount is permanently appropriated, it becomes available in the following year, but if it is subject to appropriations, it is not available again until further appropriations action has occurred. an exception is when the legislation makes clear that the amounts are permanently canceled or rescinded, in which case the amounts are returned to the general fund of the u.s. treasury. rescissions and cancellations of amounts that have been designated as emergency requirements are not counted as paygo offsets for the purposes of the statutory pay-as-you-go act of 2010. in addition, rescissions and cancellations of amounts that have been designated pursuant to a concurrent resolution on the budget or bbedca as emergency requirements, as appropriations for overseas contingency operations/global war on terrorism (oco), or as disaster funding are not counted as discretionary offsets for appropriations of non-emergency, non-oco, or non-disaster funds. (j) transfer (1) definition. transfer means to reduce budgetary resources (budget authority and unobligated balances) in one account and increase them in another, by the same amount. (2) authority. you can\\'t make a transfer unless a law authorizes it. the law may specify a particular transfer or provide general transfer authority within specified limits. (3) expenditure transfer or nonexpenditure transfer. a transfer is recorded as either an expenditure transfer, which involves an outlay, or a nonexpenditure transfer, which does not involve an outlay. which you record usually depends on the purpose of the transfer, as explained in the following table, except that nonexpenditure transfers are limited to transactions in which both accounts are within the same fund group (i.e., trust-to-trust or federal-to-federal). see also exhibit 20. if the transfer... record as... (1) purchases goods or services that benefit the transferring account for example, economy act transactions or purchases from revolving funds (including working capital funds), such as, a rental payment to gsa\\'s federal buildings fund‚Ä¶ an expenditure transfer. (2) shifts budgetary resources between federal funds (general, special, and revolving fund accounts) and trust funds (trust fund and trust revolving fund accounts), regardless of the purpose... an expenditure transfer. (3) reduces budgetary resources available for the activities of the transferring account and increases them for the activities of the receiving account (for example, a transfer of unobligated balances from the construction account to the salaries and expense account to fund pay raises) other than between federal and trust funds... a non-expenditure transfer. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 21 of section 20 section 20‚Äîterms and concepts if the transfer... record as... (4) corresponds to a transfer of an activity from one account to another a non-expenditure such as in a reorganization)... transfer. (4) recording transfers in the budget: ‚Ä¢ expenditure transfers. record an expenditure transfer as an obligation (against new budget authority or unobligated balances) and an outlay in the transferring account and as an offsetting collection or offsetting receipt in the receiving account (see section 20.7). if the receiving account is a general fund appropriation account or a revolving fund account (including a trust revolving fund), credit the amount as an offsetting collection to the appropriation or revolving fund account. if the receiving account is a special fund or trust fund account, you would normally credit the amount as an offsetting receipt to a receipt account of the fund. ‚Ä¢ nonexpenditure transfers. do not record an obligation or an outlay or an offsetting collection or offsetting receipt. record nonexpenditure transfers as a decrease either in budget authority or unobligated balances in the transferring account and as an increase either in budgetary authority or unobligated balances in the gaining account. whether you record the reduction and increase as a change in budget authority or unobligated balances, depends on the circumstances, as described in the following table. if you transfer... and the transfer... record... unobligated balances results from a transfer specified in law that changes the purpose for which the funds will be used, other than general transfer authority provided in a standing provision of law enacted before the a decrease in budget authority in the transferring account and an increase in budget authority in the gaining account. budget authority was provided. unobligated balances results from general transfer authority provided in a standing provision of law enacted before the budget authority was provided, or a decrease in unobligated balances in the transferring account and an increase in unobligated balances in the gaining account. corresponds to a transfer of an activity such that the purpose does not change (e.g., reorganizations authorized by law) budget authority in the year it becomes available is for any purpose a decrease in budget authority in the transferring account and an increase in budget page 22 of section 20 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 20‚Äîterms and concepts if you transfer... and the transfer... record... authority in the gaining account. (k) transfer in the estimates a transfer in the estimates means the budget proposes to stop funding an activity under one budget account and start funding the activity under another budget account, beginning in the budget year. this does not involve a transfer of budgetary resources like that discussed in subsection (j). you simply stop showing budget authority in the one account and start showing it in the other. a transfer in the estimates usually reflects a proposal to do one of the following in the budget year: ‚Ä¢ transfer the funding of an activity from one account to another. ‚Ä¢ consolidate funding for related activities from two or more accounts into a single account. ‚Ä¢ disaggregate the funding for an activity from one account between two or more accounts. see section 82.15 for guidance on presenting these amounts in the program and financing schedules for the transferring and receiving accounts. (l) allocation allocation means a delegation, authorized in law, by one agency to another agency, of its authority to obligate budget authority and outlay funds. when an agency makes such a delegation, the treasury department establishes a subsidiary account called a \"transfer appropriation account\", and the receiving agency may obligate up to the amount included in the account. the budget doesn\\'t show the transfer appropriation account separately. the budget schedules for the parent account include the obligations by the other agency against the subsidiary account. allocations are appropriate where the receiving agency is acting as the agent for the allocating agency. 20.5 when should i record obligations and in what amounts? (a) the general rule obligation means a legally binding agreement that will result in outlays, immediately or in the future. when you place an order, sign a contract, award a grant, purchase a service, or take other actions that require the government to make payments to the public or from one government account to another, you incur an obligation. it is a violation of the antideficiency act (31 u.s.c. 1341(a)) to involve the federal government in a contract or obligation for payment of money before an appropriation is made, unless authorized by law. this means you cannot incur obligations in a vacuum; you incur an obligation against budget authority in a treasury account that belongs to your agency. it is a violation of the antideficiency act to incur an obligation in an amount greater than the amount available in the treasury account that is available. this means that the account must have budget authority sufficient to cover the total of such obligations at the time the obligation is incurred. in addition, the obligation you incur must conform to other applicable provisions of law, and you must be able to support the amounts reported by the documentary evidence required by 31 u.s.c. 1501. moreover, you are required to maintain certifications and records showing that the amounts have been obligated (31 u.s.c. 1108). the following subsections omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 23 of section 20 section 20‚Äîterms and concepts provide additional guidance on when to record obligations for the different types of goods and services or the amount. (b) personnel compensation and benefits for personnel compensation and benefits the issue is usually the \"timing\" of the obligation and not the \"amount\" of the obligation. the amount is prescribed by laws that cover the civil service and the uniformed service and determined by well-established personnel procedures. as for the timing of the obligation, the amounts generally are recorded as obligations as the amounts are earned during the reporting pay period, with the following exceptions: type of obligations... severance pay authorized reimbursable expenses estimated to be paid to employees for real estate, temporary subsistence, and other expenses incident to relocation at the request of the government at the time ... it is paid on a pay period by pay period basis the individual travel orders are approved because... severance pay is not earned with regular salaries and wages. the travel is a bona fide need at the time the order is approved. cash awards that do not become part of the employee\\'s basic rate of pay allowances for uniforms and quarters subsidies for commuting costs when payable to the employee this is the time the amount is definite. unemployment compensation payments to the department of labor for former federal employees when the agency receives the bills rendered by labor underlying law. annual leave when it becomes due and payable as terminal leave or taken in lieu of a lump sum payment normally, annual leave is unfunded. funded annual leave when you transfer a person from a revolving fund to another revolving fund, you obligate the employee\\'s share of funded annual leave and you pay it to the fund to which the employee is transferred the revolving fund to which the employee is transferred will pay the employee\\'s salary and wages when the employee takes the annual leave or will pay the lump sum terminal leave for any annual leave not taken. page 24 of section 20 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 20‚Äîterms and concepts type of obligations... at the time ... because... when you transfer a person from a revolving fund to a non-revolving fund, you obligate the employee\\'s portion of the funded annual leave and pay miscellaneous receipts in the general fund of the treasury the appropriation from the general fund in the treasury will pay the employee\\'s salaries and wages when the employee takes the annual leave or will pay the lump sum terminal leave for any annual leave not taken. (c) contractual services and supplies services and supplies that are purchased by contract are recorded as obligations at the time there is a binding agreement, which is usually when the contract is signed. as a general rule, the amount of the obligation is the maximum liability to the federal government. the maximum liability to the government is normally limited by the terms of the contract (e.g., cancellation clauses). the following provides the nuances of contracts with certain characteristics. contracts with... amount obligated is‚Ä¶ at the time ... a maximum price the maximum price the contract is signed. amount of downward adjustments (i.e. deobligation), if any there is documentary evidence that the price is reduced. letters of intent and letter contracts normally, no amount is obligated the letter is signed. however, if the letters constitute binding agreements under which the contractor is the maximum amount indicated in the letter that the contractor is authorized to incur to authorized to proceed cover expenses prior to the execution of a definitive contract contracts for variable normally, no amount is the contract is signed. quantities obligated the contracts are usually the amount of actual the order is issued. followed by \"purchase orders orders\" that do obligate the government orders where a law the amount of the order the order is issued. \"requires\" that you to place orders with another federal government account omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 25 of section 20 section 20‚Äîterms and concepts contracts with... amount obligated is‚Ä¶ at the time ... voluntary orders with other federal government the amount of the order the order is issued. accounts: if the order is for common-use standard stock item the supplier has on hand or on order at published prices that you issue the order to the supplier. if the order is for stock items other than the above you receive a formal notification that the items are on hand or on order. if the order involves execution of a specific contract the supplying agency notifies you that it has entered into the contract. (d) intragovernmental services and supplies obligations are incurred for services when they are rendered. for example, obligations for gsa rental payments are incurred in the year in which the premises are occupied, whether or not a bill has been rendered. obligations are incurred for supplies when the order is placed. (e) land and structures contracts for lands and structures generally follow the same rules as for contracts specified above with the following exceptions. in the case of condemnation proceedings, the amount obligated is the estimated amount for the price of the land, adjusted to the amount of the payment to be held in escrow where there is a declaration of a taking. it is obligated at the time when you ask the attorney general to start condemnation proceedings. in the case of lease purchases and capital leases covered by the scorekeeping rules developed under the budget enforcement act, see the requirements in appendix b. (f) grants and fixed charges discretionary grants will be obligated after the amounts are determined administratively and recorded at the time the grant award is signed. the grant award is normally the documentary evidence that the grant has been awarded. letters of credit are issued after the grant awards are made and generally are not obligating documents. for grants and fixed charges with formulas in law that automatically fix the amount of the charges, record the amount determined by the formula or, if there is an appropriation, then record the amount appropriated, whichever is smaller. the obligation is reported at the time the grantee is awarded the grant and is liquidated when the payment is made to the grantee. to the extent that a grant awarded in a previous year is no longer valid, you will record a recovery of prior year obligations. page 26 of section 20 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 20‚Äîterms and concepts the exceptions follow: grants or fixed charges‚Ä¶ amount obligated is‚Ä¶ at the time ... in lieu of taxes interest dividends the amount appropriated the amount owed the amount declared the taxes are due. the interest is payable. the dividend is declared. (g) federal credit programs obligations in federal credit programs generally follow the same rules as for \"personnel compensation and benefits\" and \"contracts\" specified above with the following exceptions. the amount is‚Ä¶ amount obligated is‚Ä¶ at the time ... subsidy in direct loan program account the portion of the subsidy cost for the direct loan contract that you are signing you sign the direct loan contract. that is, when you enter into a binding agreement to make a direct loan when specified conditions are fulfilled by the borrower. subsidy in guaranteed loan program account the portion of the subsidy cost for the binding agreement to make a loan guarantee you make the loan guarantee commitment. that is, when you enter into a binding agreement to make a loan guarantee when special conditions are fulfilled by the borrower, the lender, or any other party to the guarantee agreement. 20.6 what do i need to know about outlays? outlay means a payment to liquidate an obligation (other than the repayment to the treasury of debt principal). outlays are a measure of government spending. as required by law, the budget presents some outlays as \"on-budget\" and some as \"off-budget.\" total outlays for the federal government include both on-budget and off-budget outlays. government-wide outlay totals are stated net of refunds, offsetting collections, and offsetting receipts. function, subfunction, and agency outlay totals are stated net of related refunds, offsetting collections, and offsetting receipts for most budget presentations. in contrast, offsetting receipts generally are not netted against gross outlays at the bureau level, but when general fund payments are used to finance trust fund outlays to the public, the associated trust fund offsetting receipts are netted against the bureau totals to prevent double-counting budget authority and outlays at the bureau level. (offsetting receipts from a few sources do not offset any specific function, subfunction, or agency, but only offset government-wide outlay totals.) outlay totals for accounts with offsetting collections are stated both gross and net of the offsetting collections credited to the account. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 27 of section 20 section 20‚Äîterms and concepts the government usually makes payments in the form of cash (currency, checks, or electronic fund transfers), and you record outlays equal to the disbursement at the time of the disbursement. normally the amount of cash disbursed appropriately measures the value of the transaction. in other cases, however, the cash disbursed does not accurately measure the value of the transactions. in these cases, we require you to record the cash-equivalent value of the transactions (see section 20.8). not every disbursement is an outlay because not every disbursement liquidates an obligation. you don\\'t record outlays for the following: ‚Ä¢ repayment of debt principal because we treat borrowing and the repayment of debt principal as a means of financing. ‚Ä¢ disbursements to the public by federal credit programs for direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments made in fiscal year 1992 or later (and those made prior to that year if they have been modified) because we treat the cash flows to and from the government for credit programs as a means of financing. we record outlays equal to the subsidy cost of direct loans and loan guarantees when the underlying direct or guaranteed loans are disbursed. disbursements from liquidating accounts for direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments made prior to fiscal year 1992 are treated as outlays (see section 185). ‚Ä¢ disbursements from deposit funds because these funds are on deposit with the government, but are not owned by the government and are therefore excluded from the budget (see section 20.7). ‚Ä¢ refunds of receipts that result from overpayments because they are recorded as decreases in receipts, rather than as increases in outlays (see section 20.9). the timing for recording outlays for interest payments varies. treasury records outlays for the interest on the public issues of treasury debt securities as the interest accrues, not when it pays the cash. however, most treasury debt securities held by government accounts are in the government account series. treasury normally records the interest payments on these securities when it pays the cash, and you normally record an offsetting collection or receipt on a cash basis. the department records interest as the amortization occurs. we discuss the budget treatment of investment transactions in section 113. outlays during a fiscal year may liquidate obligations incurred in the same year or in prior years. obligations, in turn, may be incurred against budget authority provided in the same year or against unobligated balances of budget authority provided in prior years. outlays, therefore, flow in part from budget authority provided for the year in which the money is spent and in part from budget authority provided in prior years. the ratio of the outlays resulting from budget authority enacted in any year to the amount of that budget authority is referred to as the spendout rate for that year. outlays for the past year must agree with amounts reported in the treasury combined statement, unless omb approves an exception. 20.7 what do i need to know about governmental receipts, offsetting collections, and offsetting receipts? (a) overview the money collected by the federal government and its accounts that is counted as income in the budget is classified as either governmental receipts (also known as receipts or revenues) or as offsets to budget authority and outlays. we sometimes use the generic term collections when referring to all of this money. collections result from the following transactions: page 28 of section 20 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 20‚Äîterms and concepts ‚Ä¢ sovereign power‚Äîpayments from the public that result primarily from the government\\'s exercise of its sovereign power to tax or otherwise compel payment. ‚Ä¢ business-like transactions with the public, including payments from the public in exchange for goods and services; reimbursements for damages; and gifts or donations of money to the government. ‚Ä¢ intragovernmental transactions‚Äîpayments from other federal government accounts. the universe of money collected also includes the proceeds of borrowing and the other means of financing which are not treated as collections in the budget. means of financing are discussed in section 20.7 (h). the federal government normally receives payments in the form of cash and normally records amounts equal to the amount of cash received at the time of collection. usually the amount of cash collected appropriately measures the value of the transaction. in some cases, the cash collected does not accurately measure the value of the transaction. in these cases, you record the cash equivalent value of the transactions (see section 20.8). as recommended by the 1967 president‚Äôs commission on budget concepts, the budget records money collected by government agencies in one of two ways‚Äîdepending on the nature of the activity generating the collection and the law that established the collection: governmental receipts, which are compared in total to outlays (net of offsetting collections and offsetting receipts) to calculate the surplus or deficit; or offsets to budget authority and outlays (classified as either offsetting collections or offsetting receipts), which are deducted from gross budget authority and outlays to produce net budget authority and outlay figures. (b) governmental receipts governmental receipts are collections that result from the government\\'s exercise of its sovereign power to tax or otherwise compel payment. sometimes they are called receipts, federal receipts, or revenues. they consist mostly of individual and corporation income taxes and social insurance taxes, but also include excise taxes, compulsory user charges, regulatory fees, custom duties, court fines, certain license fees, and deposits omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 29 of section 20 section 20‚Äîterms and concepts of earning by the federal reserve system. governmental receipts are deposited in receipt accounts. see section 20.7(f) for more detail on receipt accounts. the types of governmental receipts are summarized in the diagram below. total governmental receipts for the federal government include both on-budget and off-budget receipts. for more information on collections, see chapters 11 and 12, \"federal receipts\" in the analytical perspectives volume of the budget. (c) general information about offsets to budget authority and outlays offsetting collections and offsetting receipts are recorded as offsets to spending, not as additions to the receipt side of the budget. they are recorded as offsets to spending so that the budget totals represent governmental rather than market activity and to prevent double counting from intragovernmental transactions. this ensures that the budget totals measure the transactions of the government with the public. they are recorded in the budget in one of two ways, based on interpretation of laws and longstanding budget concepts and practice. they are offsetting collections when the collections are authorized to be credited to expenditure accounts. otherwise, they are deposited in receipt accounts and called offsetting receipts. see section 20.7(f) for more detail on receipt and expenditure accounts. offsetting collections and offsetting receipts are classified according to the type and source of the money collected and how it is treated in the budget. offsetting collections and offsetting receipts result from one of the following types of transactions: business-like transactions with the public‚Äîthese include voluntary collections from the public in exchange for goods or services; reimbursements for damages (e.g., recoveries by the hazardous substance superfund); and gifts of money to the government. the budget records these amounts as offsetting collections from non-federal resources for offsetting collections or as proprietary receipts for offsetting receipts. the amounts are deducted from gross budget authority and gross outlays, rather than added to receipts. this produces budget totals for receipts, budget authority, and outlays that represent governmental rather than market activity. page 30 of section 20 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 20‚Äîterms and concepts intragovernmental transactions‚Äîcollections from other federal government accounts. the budget records collections by one government account from another as offsetting collections from federal sources for offsetting collections or as intragovernmental receipts for offsetting receipts. intragovernmental offsetting receipts can be further divided into two categories: ‚Ä¢ interfund receipts, which involve transactions between federal and trust fund accounts; and ‚Ä¢ intrafund receipts, which involve transactions between the same types of fund groups (i.e., from federal fund to federal fund or from trust fund to trust fund. the amounts are deducted from gross budget authority and gross outlays so that the budget totals measure the transactions of the government with the public. offsetting governmental transactions‚Äîcollections from the public that are governmental in nature (e.g., tax receipts, regulatory fees, compulsory user charges), but required by law to be misclassified as offsetting. the budget records amounts from non-federal sources that are governmental in nature as offsetting governmental collections for offsetting collections or as offsetting governmental receipts for offsetting receipts. (d) offsetting collections some laws authorize agencies to credit collections directly to the account from which they will be spent. most revolving funds operate with such authority. offsetting collections credited to expenditure accounts automatically offset outlays and budget authority at the expenditure account level. where accounts have offsetting collections, the budget shows the budget authority and outlays of the account both gross (before deducting offsetting collections) and net (after deducting offsetting collections). totals for the agency, subfunction, and budget are net of offsetting collections. line codes are used to identify the source of the collections in omb\\'s budget database. see section 82.18 for the offsetting collection line entries and the definitions. the offsets are used to arrive at net budget authority and outlays for the account and are presented in the program and financing (schedule p) in the appendix to the president\\'s budget. the following chart summarizes the types of offsetting collections and the associated line codes reported in max: omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 31 of section 20 section 20‚Äîterms and concepts (e) offsetting receipts collections that are offset against gross outlays and budget authority but are not authorized to be credited to expenditure accounts are credited to receipt accounts and are called offsetting receipts. they are deducted from budget authority and outlays in arriving at total budget authority and outlays. however, unlike offsetting collections that are credited to expenditure accounts, offsetting receipts do not offset budget authority and outlays at the account level. most offsetting receipts deposited in receipt accounts are offset at the agency and subfunction levels, and the offsetting receipts of certain general fund payments are offset at the bureau levels. we call these distributed offsetting receipts. a few offsetting receipts are offset at government-wide totals. we call these undistributed offsetting receipts. for more information on the magnitude of undistributed offsetting receipts see table 25-1 in the analytical perspectives volume of the president\\'s budget. within omb\\'s budget database, offsetting receipts are coded to identify the types of offsetting receipt (e.g., proprietary, offsetting governmental, intragovernmental) and to identify how they are treated (e.g., offset at the agency and function level). each offsetting receipt type also has a number of unique and associated source category codes that enable max to produce tables needed for the budget. these are assigned by omb when the account is established (see exhibit 79b). the following chart summarizes the receipt types, with associated receipt type codes in parentheses, for the various types of offsetting receipts. (f) receipt accounts and expenditure accounts the placement of collections in receipt accounts or expenditure accounts is based on the interpretation of laws and long-standing budget concepts and practice. page 32 of section 20 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 20‚Äîterms and concepts receipt accounts.‚Äîa general law requires that, except as provided by another law, an official or agent of the government who receives money for the federal government from any source shall deposit the money in the treasury as soon as practicable. this law (31 u.s.c. 3302) is generally referred to as the \"miscellaneous receipts act.\" the department of the treasury, in consultation with omb, interprets this law as requiring all collections to be deposited in general fund receipt accounts, which as a group comprise part of \"the general fund.\" some laws earmark collections from a certain source for a specific purpose. depending on the legal requirements, treasury deposits these collections in special fund receipt accounts, trust fund receipt accounts, or credits the collections directly to expenditure accounts, including revolving fund accounts. the legislation also specifies whether the earmarked receipts are (i) available for obligation and outlay without further appropriations action by the congress (i.e., available), or (ii) not available for obligation or outlay until the congress makes the amounts available in annual appropriations or other acts (i.e., unavailable). however, in some cases, receipts are considered to be unavailable because a benefit formula or limitation precludes their use. these amounts of receipts may become available subsequently without appropriations action. see section 20.4(b) for more information about amounts precluded from obligation. when the collections in the receipt accounts are available for obligation and outlay, the amounts are appropriated to general fund, special fund, trust fund, or other expenditure accounts, as discussed below. expenditure accounts.‚Äîsome laws override the requirement to first deposit collections in receipt accounts. these collections are credited directly to expenditure accounts, where the collections are generally available for obligation and outlay without further action by the congress. these collections are called offsetting collections. most revolving funds operate under such authority. these include public enterprise, intragovernmental, and trust revolving funds. in addition, the economy act allows federal agencies or bureaus within agencies to do work for each other. when one account reimburses another account for this work, the act authorizes the collections to be credited directly to the expenditure account that provided the goods and services. (g) user charges user charge means a fee, charge, or assessment the government levies on a class of the public directly benefiting from, or subject to regulation by, a government program or activity. we record user charges as governmental receipts, offsetting collections, or offsetting receipts using the criteria described above. the authorizing law must limit the payers of the charges to those benefiting from, or subject to regulation by, the program or activity. user charges include: ‚Ä¢ collections from non-federal sources for goods and services provided (for example, the proceeds from the sale of goods by defense commissaries, electricity by power marketing administrations, stamps by the postal service; fees charged to enter national parks; and premiums charged for flood and health insurance); ‚Ä¢ voluntary payments to social insurance programs, such as medicare part b insurance premiums; ‚Ä¢ miscellaneous customs fees (for example, united states customs service merchandise processing fees); ‚Ä¢ proceeds from asset sales (property, plant, and equipment); ‚Ä¢ proceeds from the sale of natural resources (such as timber, oil, and minerals); ‚Ä¢ outer continental shelf receipts; ‚Ä¢ spectrum auction proceeds; omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 33 of section 20 section 20‚Äîterms and concepts ‚Ä¢ many fees for permits, and regulatory and judicial services; ‚Ä¢ specific taxes and duties on an exception basis; and ‚Ä¢ credit program fees deposited into the credit program account and recorded in the budget on a current basis. user charges do not include: ‚Ä¢ collections from other federal accounts; ‚Ä¢ collections associated with credit programs, except for credit program fees deposited into credit program accounts and recorded in the budget on a current basis; ‚Ä¢ realizations upon loans and investments; ‚Ä¢ interest, dividends, and other earnings; ‚Ä¢ payments to social insurance programs required by law; ‚Ä¢ excise taxes; ‚Ä¢ customs duties; ‚Ä¢ fines, penalties, and forfeitures; ‚Ä¢ cost-sharing contributions; and ‚Ä¢ federal reserve system deposits of earnings. (h) means of financing these are monies received or paid by the government that are not counted in the budget totals as either collections (governmental receipts, offsetting collections, or offsetting receipts) or outgo (outlays). borrowing and the repayment of debt are the primary means of financing. others are listed below. these monies finance outlays when there is a deficit‚Äîthat is, when outlays (net of offsetting collections and offsetting receipts) exceed receipts. when there is a surplus‚Äîthat is, when receipts exceed outlays (net of offsetting collections and offsetting receipts)‚Äîthe means of financing may be used, together with the surplus, to retire debt. most of the individual means of financing represent changes in assets or liabilities and therefore can either be a source of financing for the government or require financing themselves. for example, if the disbursements from credit financing accounts exceed their collections, which is normal, the difference must be financed by receipts or the other means of financing; if the disbursements are less than the collections, the difference may be used to reduce borrowing or to provide any financing required by the other means of financing. the means of financing other than borrowing and repayment of debt include: ‚Ä¢ net financing disbursements by direct loan and guaranteed loan financing accounts; ‚Ä¢ seigniorage (the profit from coining money) and profits on the sale of gold (a monetary asset); ‚Ä¢ certain exchanges of cash, such as deposits by the u.s. in the international monetary fund; ‚Ä¢ changes in treasury\\'s operating cash balance, uninvested deposit fund balances, and checks outstanding; and ‚Ä¢ treasury debt buyback premiums and discounts (see section 113). for more information on the means of financing, see the section on budget deficit or surplus and means of financing in chapter 9, \"budget concepts\" of the analytical perspectives volume of the president\\'s budget. page 34 of section 20 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 20‚Äîterms and concepts 20.8 what do i need to know about cash-equivalent transactions? normally the amount of cash disbursed or collected is the appropriate measure of the value of the transaction, and you record outlays or collections equal to the cash that changes hands. in other cases, however, the cash disbursed or collected doesn\\'t accurately measure the value of the transactions. in these cases, you should record the cash-equivalent value of the transactions in the budget. the following are some examples of cash-equivalent transactions: ‚Ä¢ federal employee salaries. you record an outlay for the full amount of an employee\\'s salary, even though the cash disbursement is net of federal and state income taxes, retirement contributions, life and health insurance premiums, and other deductions. we record collections for the deductions that are payments to the government. ‚Ä¢ debt instruments. when the government receives or makes payments in the form of debt instruments (such as bonds, debentures, monetary credits, or notes) in lieu of cash, we record collections or outlays in the budget on a cash-equivalent basis. the government can borrow from the public to raise cash and then outlay the cash proceeds to liquidate an obligation, or, if authorized in law, it may liquidate the obligation by issuing securities in lieu of the cash. the latter method combines two transactions into one‚Äîborrowing and an outlay. combining these transactions into one does not change the nature of the transactions. since the two methods of payment are equivalent, we require you to record the same amount of outlays for both cases. similarly, when the government accepts securities in lieu of cash from the public in payment of an obligation owed to the government, we record offsetting receipts or collections. in one program, for example, a government agency may choose whether to pay default claims against it in cash or by issuing debentures in lieu of cash; the agency records the same amount of outlays in either case. in turn, a recipient of these debentures may choose to pay the fees that it owes to the government either in cash or by returning debentures of equivalent value that it holds. the agency records the same amount of offsetting receipts or collections in either case. ‚Ä¢ lease-purchases. we require you to record an outlay for the acquisition of physical assets through certain types of lease-purchase arrangements as though the transaction was an outright purchase or direct federal construction. lease-purchase transactions in which the government assumes substantial risk are equivalent to the government raising cash by borrowing from the public and purchasing the asset directly by disbursing the cash proceeds. you must report outlays over the period that the contractor constructs, manufactures, or purchases the asset that will be leased to the government, not when the government disburses cash to the developer for lease payments. because the government pays no cash up front to the nominal owner of the asset, the transaction creates a government debt. in such cases, we treat the subsequent cash lease payments as the equivalent of interest outlays on that debt and principal repayments. (see appendix b). the scorekeeping effect of cash-equivalent transactions applies to budget authority, as well as to outlays and collections. you record the authority to incur obligations that will be liquidated through cash- equivalent payments as budget authority. the use of cash-equivalents often results in an increase or decrease in federal debt. in the previous example of the government using debentures to pay claims, we record the issuance of a debenture as an increase in debt, and we record the government\\'s acceptance of a debenture for payment of fees as a decrease in debt. we also record an increase in debt as the means of financing the cash-equivalent outlays of lease-purchase arrangements in which the government assumes substantial risk. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 35 of section 20 section 20‚Äîterms and concepts 20.9 what do i need to know about refunds? refunds are the repayments of excess payments. the amounts are directly related to previous obligations incurred and outlays made against the appropriation. refunds received are deposited to the credit of the appropriation or fund account charged with the original obligations as explained in the following table: the following table explains how to record refunds received: and the appropriation against if you receive a refund of funds which the obligation was you... that were... incurred... (1) obligated and outlayed in that remains available (usually the case) reduce the total amount of year obligations and outlays recorded for the year in the budget schedules. (2) obligated and outlayed in a remains available for new previous year and credited to the obligations same appropriation or fund account record the refund as offsetting collections (cash) credited to unexpired accounts (i.e., as offsetting collections on lines 40304034 or 4120-4124) and as recoveries of prior year paid obligations, unexpired accounts on line 4053 or 4143; increasing unobligated balances. these offsetting collections are not reported as new budget authority; they are offset against gross outlays but not against gross budget authority.

(5) receive a refund of funds that has been canceled deposit the refund in miscellaneous were obligated in a previous year receipts of the treasury. page 36 of section 20 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 20‚Äîterms and concepts record refunds paid as follows: ‚Ä¢ record refunds paid by an expenditure account as an obligation and an outlay of the account. ‚Ä¢ record refunds of receipts that result from overpayments (such as income taxes withheld in excess of a taxpayer\\'s income tax liability) as reductions of receipts, rather than as outlays. this does not include payments to a taxpayer for credits (such as an earned income tax credit) that exceed the taxpayer\\'s income tax liability. record these as outlays, not as refunds. 20.10 what do i need to know about advances? advances are amounts of money prepaid to a federal government account for the later receipt of goods, services, or other assets, or as matching funds. when an advance is required, the budgetary resource provided by the order is equal to the cash accompanying the order. the advance, per se, is not available for obligation. if both the order and the advance were available for obligation, budgetary resources would be double-counted. deposit advances with orders in the appropriate appropriation/fund or receipt account. deposit advances without orders as follows: if the advance is from... deposit the advance in... a non-federal source deposit fund account (6500) a federal source an intragovernmental clearing account (f3885) when a reimbursable agreement with another federal account is accompanied by a cash advance, you may disburse to pay obligations associated with that advance. however, if you are authorized to incur obligations against customer orders from other federal accounts without an advance, the order establishes obligational authority only and you may not disburse the account into a negative position (see section 145.2 on antideficiency act violations). if you return a cash advance or other offsetting collection or special or trust fund receipts received in a prior fiscal year, you must record an obligation and an outlay in the current fiscal year. 20.11 what do i need to know about accounts and fund types? (a) accounts the term account may refer to a receipt or expenditure account. governmental receipts and offsetting receipts are deposited into receipt accounts (see section 20.7). receipt accounts are not available for incurring obligations or making outlays. expenditure accounts are provided with budget authority (e.g., appropriations or offsetting collections) and are used to incur obligations and make outlays. receipt and expenditure accounts are further classified into fund types (e.g., general funds and special funds). fund types are discussed in subsections 20.12(b) through 20.12(f) below. the term account may also refer to treasury accounts and budget accounts. when the congress provides budget authority for a particular purpose or under a particular title, it also provides a specific period of time for which the budget authority is available for obligation. this time period of availability (poa) may be annual, multi-year, or no-year. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 37 of section 20 section 20‚Äîterms and concepts treasury establishes expenditure accounts based on the poa of the resources in the account. that is, treasury establishes separate accounts with separate treasury appropriation fund symbols (tafs) for each poa, i.e., annual, multi-year, or no-year amount. for budget execution, which is governed largely by the antideficiency act, you must report data for each of the tafs expenditure accounts established by treasury (see section 130). a budget account generally covers an organized set of activities, programs, or services directed toward a common purpose or goal. for budget formulation, the appropriations and other budget authority provided to tafs accounts with the same appropriation title for the years covered by the budget are combined and presented as a single account under a single title, e.g., \"salaries and expenses.\" as an illustration, the fy 2017 column of the program and financing schedule for a \"salaries and expenses\" account in the 2019 appendix would include, as appropriate, outlays made in fy 2017 from the fy 2017 appropriation, the fy 2015‚Äì2017 multi-year appropriation, the no-year appropriation, and the five expired annual appropriations (fy 2012 through fy 2016). for receipt accounts, the budget and treasury accounts are usually the same. for information on account identification codes, see section 79.2. (b) overview of fund types agency activities are financed through general funds, special funds, and revolving funds (public enterprise revolving funds, intragovernmental revolving funds, credit financing accounts), which constitute the federal funds group, and trust funds and trust revolving funds, which constitute the trust funds group. general, special, and trust fund collections and disbursements may be held temporarily in clearing accounts pending clearance to the applicable account. agencies account for amounts that are not government funds in deposit funds. the following table summarizes the characteristics of these funds. the text following the table discusses the types of funds in more depth. page 38 of section 20 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 20‚Äîterms and concepts characteristics of fund types and their accounts fund type/account are these funds what is the purpose of the are receipt accounts and treasury account included in the account? expenditure accounts symbol budget? linked? federal funds: general fund receipt record unearmarked receipts. no. yes. accounts (0000‚Äì3899) general fund expenditure accounts (0000‚Äì3599) record budget authority, obligations, and outlays of general fund receipts and borrowing. record offsetting collections authorized by law, such as the economy act, and associated budget authority, obligations, and outlays. no, general fund appropriations draw from general fund receipts collectively. yes. special fund receipt accounts (5000‚Äì5999) record receipts earmarked by law for a specific purpose (other than business-like activity). yes. yes. special fund expenditure record budget authority, yes. yes. accounts obligations, and outlays of special fund receipts. record offsetting (5000‚Äì5999) collections authorized by law, such as the economy act, and associated budget authority, obligations, and outlays public enterprise revolving record offsetting collections not applicable. collections yes.1 funds earmarked by law for a specific are credited to the purpose and associated budget expenditure account.

(c) federal funds federal funds comprise several types of accounts or funds. a general fund receipt account records receipts not earmarked by law for a specific purpose, such as individual income tax receipts. a general fund expenditure account records appropriations from the general fund and the associated transactions, such as obligations and outlays. general fund appropriations draw from general fund receipts collectively and, therefore, are not specifically linked to receipt accounts. the federal funds group also includes special funds and revolving funds, both of which earmark collections for spending on specific purposes. we establish a special fund where the law requires us to earmark collections from a specified source to finance a particular program, and the law neither authorizes the fund to conduct a cycle of business-type operations (making it a revolving fund) nor designates it as a trust fund. for example, a law established the land and water conservation fund, earmarking a portion of rents and royalties from outer continental shelf lands and other receipts to be used for land acquisition, conservation, and recreation programs. the receipts earmarked to a fund are recorded in one or more special fund receipt accounts. more than one receipt account may be necessary to distinguish different types of receipts (governmental, proprietary, etc.) and receipts from significantly different types of transactions (registration fees vs. fines and penalties, for example). the fund\\'s appropriations and associated transactions are recorded in a special fund expenditure account. most funds have only one expenditure account, even if they have multiple receipt accounts. however, a large fund, especially one with appropriations to more than one agency (such as the land and water conservation fund), may have more than one expenditure account. the majority of special fund collections are derived from the government\\'s power to impose taxes, fines, and other compulsory payments, and they must be appropriated before they can be obligated and spent. revolving funds conduct continuing cycles of business-like activity. they charge for the sale of products or services and use the proceeds to finance their spending. instead of recording the collections in receipt accounts (as offsetting receipts), the budget records the collections and the outlays of revolving funds in the same account. the laws that establish revolving funds authorize the collections to be obligated and outlayed for the purposes of the fund without further appropriation. the law of supply and demand is expected to regulate such funds. however, in some cases, the congress enacts obligation limitations on the funds in appropriations acts as a way of controlling their expenditures (for example, a limitation on administrative expenses). there are two types of revolving funds in the federal funds group. public enterprise funds, such as the postal service fund, conduct business-like operations mainly with the public. intragovernmental funds, such as the federal buildings fund, conduct business-like operations mainly within and between government agencies. (d) trust funds trust funds account for the receipt and expenditure of monies by the government for carrying out specific purposes and programs in accordance with the terms of a statute that designates the fund as a trust fund (such as the highway trust fund) or for carrying out the stipulations of a trust agreement where the nation is the beneficiary (such as any of several trust funds for gifts and donations for specific purposes). like special funds and revolving funds, trust funds earmark collections for spending on specific purposes. many of the larger trust funds finance social insurance payments for individuals, such as social security, medicare, and unemployment compensation. other major trust funds finance military and federal civilian employees\\' retirement, highway and mass transit construction, and airport and airway development. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 41 of section 20 section 20‚Äîterms and concepts a trust fund normally consists of one or more receipt accounts to record receipts and an expenditure account to record the appropriation of the receipts and associated transactions. some trust funds have multiple receipt accounts for the same reasons that special funds have them. also, like special funds, large trust funds (such as the highway trust fund) may have multiple expenditure accounts. a few trust funds, such as the veterans special life insurance fund and the employees life insurance fund, are established by law as revolving funds. these funds operate the same way as revolving funds in the federal funds group, and we call them trust revolving funds. they conduct a cycle of business-type operations. the collections are credited to the expenditure account as offsetting collections and their outlays are displayed net of collections in a single expenditure account. the federal budget meaning of the term \"trust\", as applied to trust fund accounts, differs significantly from its private sector usage. in the private sector, the beneficiary of a trust usually owns the trust\\'s assets, which are managed by a trustee who must follow the stipulations of the trust. in contrast, the federal government owns the assets of most federal trust funds, and it can raise or lower future trust fund collections and payments, or change the purposes for which the collections are used, by changing existing laws. there is no substantive difference between these trust funds and special funds or between trust revolving funds and public enterprise revolving funds. whether a particular fund is designated in law as a trust fund is, in many cases, arbitrary. for example, the national service life insurance fund is a trust fund, but the servicemen\\'s group life insurance fund is a federal fund, even though both are financed by earmarked fees paid by veterans and both provide life insurance payments to veterans\\' beneficiaries. there are a few federal trust funds that are managed pursuant to a trust agreement. these are identified in the budget as \"gift funds\". in addition, the government does act as a true trustee on behalf of some entities outside of the government where it makes no decisions about the amount of these deposits or how they are spent. for example, it maintains accounts on behalf of individual federal employees in the thrift savings fund, investing them as directed by the individual employee. the government accounts for such funds in deposit funds (see the section after next). in cases where the law provides an appropriation from the general fund of the u.s. treasury to a trust fund, a general fund expenditure account and an associated trust fund receipt account are used to record the financial transaction that moves resources between fund types. (e) clearing accounts you use clearing accounts to temporarily account for transactions that you know belong to the government while you wait for information that will allow you to match the transaction to a specific receipt or expenditure account. for example: ‚Ä¢ to temporarily credit unclassified transactions from the public when there is a reasonable presumption that the amounts belong to a federal government account other than miscellaneous receipts in the treasury. ‚Ä¢ to temporarily credit unclassified transactions between federal agencies, including intragovernmental payment and collection (ipac) transactions. you should not use clearing accounts to mask an overobligation or overexpenditure of an expenditure account. (f) deposit funds you use deposit funds to account for monies that do not belong to the government. this includes monies held temporarily by the government until ownership is determined (such as earnest money paid by bidders for mineral leases) or held by the government as an agent for others (such as state and local income taxes page 42 of section 20 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 20‚Äîterms and concepts withheld from federal employees\\' salaries and not yet paid to the state or local government). we exclude deposit fund transactions, as such, from the budget totals because the funds are not owned by the government. therefore, the budget records transactions between deposit funds and budgetary accounts as transactions with the public. for example, when the mineral leasing process has been completed, the winning bidder\\'s earnest money is transferred from the deposit fund to the appropriate receipt account and the budget records a receipt. similarly, outlays are recorded in an agency\\'s salaries and expense account when a federal employee is paid, even though some of the amount is transferred to a deposit fund for state and local income taxes withheld and paid later to the state and local government. deposits and associated disbursements are recorded in the same account. 20.12 what do i need to know about reimbursable work? agencies can perform reimbursable work for the public or other federal agencies. the types of laws that allow you to use advances or reimbursements in return for providing others with goods and services are: ‚Ä¢ laws that establish revolving funds, including franchise funds and working capital funds; ‚Ä¢ provisions in appropriations or substantive laws that allow agencies to use the amounts they collect; and ‚Ä¢ the economy act (31.u.s.c. 1535). generally speaking, laws that authorize an agency to enter into a \"reimbursable agreement\" with non- federal transaction partners only provide authority to deposit collections into the agency\\'s account, rather than the miscellaneous receipts account (31 u.s.c. 3302). one such example is the intergovernmental cooperation act of 1969 (31 u.s.c. 6501). authority to enter into a \"reimbursable agreement\" is not sufficient to allow you to record a budgetary resource against account receivable absent additional express statutory authority to do so. (a) revolving funds you may use a revolving fund when a law establishes the revolving funds and authorizes you to credit payments to the revolving fund that performs the work. revolving funds operate on a reimbursable basis when working capital (undisbursed cash) is available. otherwise, advance payments must accompany orders. you may not disburse revolving funds into a negative cash position in anticipation of federal or non-federal reimbursements because of the antideficiency act. (b) payments from non-federal entities if the law authorizes an expenditure account to perform work for the public and to credit collections from non-federal entities as spending authority, you may cover obligations incurred by the account by: ‚Ä¢ advances collected up to the amount of accompanying orders (see section 20.10 for treatment of advances); and ‚Ä¢ working capital that is available for this purpose. (c) economy act the act authorizes the head of an agency or major organizational unit within an agency to place an order with a major organizational unit within the same agency or another federal agency for goods or services provided that: ‚Ä¢ the ordering agency has enough money to pay for the order; omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 43 of section 20 section 20‚Äîterms and concepts ‚Ä¢ the head of the ordering agency or unit decides the order is in the best interest of the united states government; ‚Ä¢ the agency or unit to fill the order is able to provide or get by contract the ordered goods or services; ‚Ä¢ the head of the ordering agency decides that the ordered goods or services cannot be provided by contract as conveniently or cheaply by a commercial enterprise; and ‚Ä¢ transactions authorized by the economy act are limited by the statutory requirement that the amount obligated by the ordering appropriation is required to be deobligated to the extent that the agency or unit filling the order has not incurred obligations before the end of the period of availability of the ordering appropriation. under the economy act, payment (via expenditure transfer) may be made in advance or reimbursements may be made. advances and reimbursements from other federal government appropriations are available for obligation‚Äîbut not disbursement until received‚Äîwhen the ordering appropriation records a valid obligation to cover the order. the act states that the providing (servicing) agency shall charge the ordering (requesting) agency \"on the basis of the actual cost of goods or services provided\" as agreed to by the agencies. specific questions about economy act requirements should be directed to the agency\\'s chief financial officer and/or office of general counsel. page 44 of section 20 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) exhibit 20a section 20‚Äîterms and concepts transfers1 of budgetary resources among federal government accounts type of transaction nature of transaction treasury accounting treatment budget treatment i. nonexpenditure transfers a. transfer of authority to obligate transfers to carry out the purposes of the receiving account, for example, to shift resources from one purpose to another or to reflect a reorganization. transfer via s.f. 1151 the transferring account reports a transfer out of budget authority or balances. the receiving account reports a transfer in. b. allocation of authority to obligate i.e., transfers to transfer appropriation accounts transfers to carry out the purposes of the parent account. transfer via s.f. 1151 obligations and outlays are reported by the parent account. ii. expenditure transfers a. expenditure payments to carry out the payments via obligations and outlays are reported by the transfer purposes of the paying fms 224 or paying account. offsetting collections are payments account, such as electronic funds reported by the receiving account. the between two payments in return for goods transfer.2 collections are (1) advances or federal funds and services authorized under (2) repayments in the form of or between two the economy act. reimbursements or refunds. trust funds payments that represent financial interchanges between federal government accounts that are not in exchange for goods and services. b. expenditure transfer payments between federal and trust funds all transfers between the two fund groups are expenditure transfers. payments via fms 224 or electronic funds transfer. same as above. 1 a transfer is distinguished from a reprogramming in that a reprogramming always involves the shifting of budgetary resources within a treasury account whereas a transfer usually involves the shifting of budgetary resource between two treasury accounts. however, the shifting of budgetary resources within a single treasury account should be considered a transfer if the action moves budgetary resources between separate statutory appropriations. 2 for non-treasury disbursing offices, the equivalent of the fms 224 is the fms 1219, statement of accountability, and fms 1220, statement of transactions. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 45 of section 20 section 21‚Äîoverview of scoring legislation section 21‚Äîoverview of scoring legislation table of contents 21.1 what is scoring? 21.2 when does scoring occur during the budget process? 21.3 what are the basic concepts i need to know to score legislation?

(a) caps on discretionary spending (b) pay-as-you-go for mandatory spending (c) congressional enforcement procedures 21.5 what resources are available to help me score legislation? 21.6 when are scores of legislation due to omb? 21.1 what is scoring? scoring is the process of estimating the change in government spending and collections resulting from enacted or proposed legislation, compared to what would happen in the absence of that legislation. these estimates are prepared both to inform policy makers of the budgetary effects of proposed legislation, and to inform congressional and statutory budget enforcement procedures. 21.2 when does scoring occur during the budget process? scoring occurs typically during budget formulation, the consideration of proposed legislation, and after a law has been enacted. budget formulation. as part of the budget formulation process, agencies submit baseline program levels and discretionary, mandatory, and governmental receipt proposals to omb for consideration. agencies work with omb to determine the effect of proposals on budget authority, collections, and outlays based on the administration\\'s economic and technical assumptions. the scored level of budget authority, collections, and outlays for each approved budget proposal and the baseline for all programs create an overall picture of the president‚Äôs proposed fiscal path. congressional process and enactment. during the congressional legislative process, cbo is required by statute to score legislation. such scoring advises congressional committees on compliance with congressional budget enforcement procedures. during a legislative session, pursuant to statute, omb updates the congress on its estimates of the costs of the annual appropriations bills and publishes paygo scorecards that include estimates of enacted legislation that affects mandatory spending or governmental receipts. a sequestration is triggered at the end of a legislative session if omb\\'s scoring of appropriations acts determines a breach of the discretionary caps has occurred or if omb\\'s paygo scorecards show a debit in the budget year. see section 100.3 for more information on sequestration, section 100.4 for the budget enforcement reports issued by omb, and section 15.3 for more information on the congressional budget process. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (revised‚Äîdecember 2019) page 1 of section 21 section 21‚Äîoverview of scoring legislation 21.3 what are the basic concepts i need to know to score legislation? (a) overview of budget laws the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 (bbedca) divides spending into two categories‚Äîdiscretionary and mandatory. the explanatory statement of the committee of conference for the balanced budget act of 1997 (bba of 1997) classified all accounts under the appropriations committee\\'s jurisdiction at the time as discretionary, mandatory, or split between discretionary and mandatory. the \"scorekeepers\" (house and senate budget committees, cbo, and omb) consult on the classification of spending, determine the classification of new accounts, and may reclassify the designation of an existing account. discretionary and mandatory spending are controlled by different statutory enforcement procedures. the budget control act of 2011 amended bbedca, and instituted limits (\"caps\") on the amount of discretionary budget authority for 2012 through 2021. for mandatory spending, the statutory pay-as-you- go act of 2010 (paygo) reestablished and made permanent a statutory procedure to enforce deficit neutrality on new revenue and mandatory spending legislation. for more information on these statutes and budget enforcement, see chapters 9 and 11, \"budget concepts\" and \"budget process\" in the analytical perspectives volume of the budget. for detailed information on how sequestration is applied for purposes of budget enforcement, see section 100. (b) definition of discretionary spending discretionary spending is the budget authority provided by annual appropriations acts and the outlays that result from that budget authority. for example, the budget authority and outlays for the salaries and expenses of federal personnel and other operating expenses of government agencies are usually provided by annual appropriations acts and, therefore, are usually discretionary. (c) definition of mandatory spending mandatory spending, also referred to as \"direct spending,\" is budget authority and outlays provided by permanent laws. for example, permanent laws authorize payments for medicare, unemployment insurance benefits, and farm price supports, so the budget authority and outlays for these programs are mandatory. in addition, budget authority provided in annual appropriations acts for certain programs, such as medicaid, is treated as mandatory. such accounts are called \"appropriated entitlements\" or \"appropriated mandatories.\" the bba of 1997 classified these accounts as such, predominantly because the authorizing legislation directs that the government make or beneficiaries receive payments. while mandatory and discretionary classifications are used for measuring compliance with bbedca and paygo, they do not determine whether a program provides legal entitlement to a payment or benefit or the availability of funding. you should address questions about bbedca classifications and legal entitlements to your omb representative. (d) committee of jurisdiction when scoring legislative language or a budget proposal, it is important to know which congressional committees have jurisdiction over the proposal and whether the affected spending is mandatory or discretionary, or whether the proposal would affect governmental receipts. while most scoring concepts apply to each type of spending and to governmental receipts, the budget enforcement laws differ. authorizing committees have jurisdiction over mandatory (or \"direct\") spending and governmental receipts, and budget enforcement for this spending is governed by paygo. the appropriations committees have page 2 of section 21 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (revised‚Äîdecember 2019) section 21‚Äîoverview of scoring legislation jurisdiction over discretionary spending, and budget enforcement is governed by the spending limits (caps) set in bbedca. in some cases, legislative action by an appropriations committee may affect spending or receipts under the jurisdiction of an authorizing committee, and vice versa. in these cases, the budgetary effects are scored against the committee taking the legislative action. explicit omb approval is required to include authorizing language in the budget appendix, either as account-specific appropriations language or as a general provision. please consult first with your omb representative if your agency has such a proposal. both scoring and jurisdictional issues will be part of the consideration for inclusion of a proposal in the budget. see section 95.5 and 95.6 for guidance on the legislative language included in the budget appendix. (e) how are scoring estimates measured? authorizing legislation is measured as a change to outlays or governmental receipts from the president\\'s budget baseline, updated for enacted legislation and certain other actions. see section 80 for how to construct the baseline. scoring for discretionary programs is generally measured in terms of budget authority provided in appropriations acts. for both authorizing legislation and discretionary programs, offsetting collections and offsetting receipts net against both budget authority and outlays in the year they are collected. (f) economic and technical assumptions bbedca requires agency and omb scoring to use the economic and technical assumptions underlying the most recently released president\\'s budget. omb provides agencies with economic assumptions to be used for budget estimates. examples of economic assumptions include interest rate projections, housing price projections, and projections of inflation. technical assumptions are assumptions that are not determined by economic factors, such as outlay rates, caseload projections, fee collection, and loan volume. for more information on the economic and technical assumptions underlying baseline and policy estimates see section 80 and section 31. for mid-session review, omb normally provides revised economic assumptions to agencies, and asks agencies to update their technical assumptions. updates of economic and technical assumptions for the mid-session review are not used for scoring, which is based on the economic and technical assumptions from the most recently released president\\'s budget. for more information on mid-session review, see section 10.6. (g) scoring timeframes the budgetary effects of authorizing legislation and discretionary appropriations are scored over different timeframes. authorizing legislation is scored as the change to outlays or governmental receipts from the president\\'s budget baseline in each year of the budget window (the current year, the budget year, and the nine subsequent years). discretionary appropriations are scored in the current and budget year only, and the overall score for those years includes discretionary amounts provided for those years in previous appropriation acts (i.e., advance appropriations). omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (revised‚Äîdecember 2019) page 3 of section 21 section 21‚Äîoverview of scoring legislation 21.4 what are the budget enforcement mechanisms for discretionary and mandatory spending? (a) caps on discretionary budget authority bbedca specifies spending limits or \"caps,\" on discretionary budget authority for 2012 through 2021. the caps are divided between a \"revised security category\" and a \"revised nonsecurity category.\" the revised security category (or defense category) includes discretionary budget authority in the defense budget function 050, which primarily consists of the department of defense. the \"revised nonsecurity category\" (or non-defense category) includes all discretionary budget authority not included in the defense budget function 050. bbedca includes requirements for omb to adjust the caps for changes in concepts and definitions and for appropriations designated by the congress and the president as either emergency requirements or for overseas contingency operations/global war on terrorism. bbedca also specifies adjustments to the caps for appropriations for continuing disability reviews and redeterminations by the social security administration; the health care fraud and abuse control program at the department of health and human services; and appropriations designated by the congress as being for disaster relief. bbedca requires omb to provide cost estimates of each appropriations act in a report to the congress within seven days of enactment of such act and to publish three sequestration reports‚Äîa \"preview\" report when the president submits the budget, an \"update\" report in august, including a preview estimate of the adjustment for disaster funding for the upcoming fiscal year, and a \"final\" report within 15 days after the end of a session of congress (see section 100.4). if omb\\'s final discretionary sequestration report for a given fiscal year indicates that the amount of discretionary budget authority provided in appropriations acts for that year exceeds the cap for that category in that year, the president must issue a sequestration order to eliminate the breach. see section 100 for guidance on sequestration. (b) pay-as-you-go for mandatory spending paygo requires that new legislation changing governmental receipts or mandatory spending or collections must be enacted on a \"pay-as-you-go\" basis; that is, that the cumulative effects of such legislation must not increase projected on-budget deficits. the paygo statute established special scorekeeping rules, scorecards, an annual report, and a sequestration requirement. the enforcement requirements in paygo are permanent, unlike the budget enforcement mechanism for discretionary programs, and do not impose a cap on spending or a floor on governmental receipts. instead, paygo requires that bills reducing governmental receipts or increasing mandatory spending must be fully offset by enacting revenue increases or mandatory spending reductions. this requirement of deficit neutrality is not enforced on a bill-by-bill basis, but is based on two scorecards that tally the cumulative budgetary effects of paygo legislation over the course of a congressional session. the paygo rules also apply to the outlays resulting from changes in outyear budget authority for mandatory programs made in appropriations acts (chimps) and to all changes to governmental receipts made in appropriations acts. the paygo rules do not apply to increases in mandatory spending or decreases in governmental receipts that result automatically under existing law. for example, mandatory spending for benefit programs, such as unemployment insurance, rises when the population of eligible beneficiaries rises, and many benefit payments are automatically increased for inflation under existing laws. note, however, that increases in mandatory spending that result from regulations and other administrative actions are subject to page 4 of section 21 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (revised‚Äîdecember 2019) section 21‚Äîoverview of scoring legislation administrative paygo under omb memorandum m-20-06, as explained in section 31.3. also, if the congress designates a provision of mandatory spending or governmental receipts legislation as an emergency requirement, the effect of the provision is not scored as paygo. over the course of a congressional session, all paygo legislation is scored to determine the budgetary effects‚Äîcosts and savings‚Äîexcept if exempted in law. the score for each bill is recorded by omb on two paygo scorecards in which costs or savings are averaged over rolling five-year and 10-year periods (see section 100.4). omb is required to update the scorecards on a continuous basis. in addition, within 14 business days after the end of a congressional session, omb is required to issue an annual paygo report and determine whether a violation of the paygo requirement has occurred. if costs exceed savings in the budget year column of either scorecard, the president is required to issue a sequestration order implementing across-the-board cuts to nonexempt mandatory programs by an amount sufficient to offset the net costs on the paygo scorecard. this sequestration process is separate from that described above for a breach of the discretionary caps. (c) congressional enforcement procedures congress has procedural requirements for bills to advance through the legislative process. agencies may be asked to develop cost estimates to inform the congress of the budgetary effects of potential legislation. for more information on congressional enforcement procedures see section 10.5 in this circular and the section on congressional action in the \"budget concepts\" chapter in the analytical perspectives volume of the budget. 21.5 what resources are available to help me score legislation? the general concepts used by scorekeepers are found throughout circular a-11, including the resources cited below. your omb representative can provide assistance in applying the concepts, rules, and conventions for scoring legislation. appendix a, scorekeeping guidelines, is used by the house and senate budget committees, cbo, and omb in measuring compliance with the congressional budget act of 1974 (cba), as amended; the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 (bbedca), as amended; and the statutory pay-as-you-go act of 2010. appendix b, budgetary treatment of lease-purchases and leases of capital assets, is also used to assist in scoring legislative authority to enter into a variety of leasing contracts. section 20.4 addresses a variety of scoring concepts, including reappropriations, cancellations and rescissions, and transfers. additional information on paygo and the special rules for certain paygo estimates can be found on the omb website. 21.6 when are scores of legislation due to omb? mandatory and governmental receipt proposals for the budget. omb requires that all proposals included in the budget be scored and included in the appropriate transmittal code in max a-11 data entry by the deadlines provided in the annual budget season guidance. see section 79.3 for information on transmittal codes. the schedule for the 2021 budget can be found in section 25. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (revised‚Äîdecember 2019) page 5 of section 21 section 21‚Äîoverview of scoring legislation enacted authorizing legislation. agencies should work with their omb representative to finalize paygo estimates by no more than two weeks after legislation is signed into law. agencies should follow legislation affecting their programs as it moves through the congressional process in order to identify difficult scoring issues as soon as possible and to be prepared to provide scores in a timely manner to meet the requirements outlined in section 21.4(b). discretionary appropriations. the annual budget formulation schedule requires the annual appropriations request in time to complete the president\\'s budget. in addition, throughout the appropriations season, and particularly upon enactment of full-year appropriations acts, agencies are required to work with their omb representatives to resolve any questions on scoring effects so that omb can meet the statutory reporting requirements as outlined above in section 21.4(a). page 6 of section 21 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (revised‚Äîdecember 2019) section 22‚Äîcommunications with the congress and the public and clearance requirements section 22‚Äîcommunications with the congress and the public and clearance requirements table of contents 22.1 confidentiality of budget deliberations 22.2 congressional testimony and communications 22.3 clearance of materials for the congress and the media 22.4 clearance of changes to the president\\'s budget 22.5 information available to the public 22.6 congressional budget justifications summary of changes reminds agencies about their reporting requirements under the good accounting obligation in government act (section 22.6). requires agency congressional budget justification summary tables to be machine readable (section 22.6). reminds agencies to post congressional budget justifications at a vanity url (section 22.6). 22.1 confidentiality of budget deliberations the nature and amounts of the president\\'s decisions and the underlying materials are confidential. do not release the president\\'s decisions outside of your agency until the budget is transmitted to the congress. the materials underlying those decisions may not be released at any time, except in accordance with this section. in addition, outyear discretionary data is considered pre-decisional and may not be released without prior omb approval. (for additional information on the confidentiality of pre-decisional budget information, please consult omb memorandum m‚Äì01‚Äì17 of april 25, 2001.) presidential decisions on current and budget year estimates (other than forecasts of items that will be transmitted formally later), both in total and in detail, become the \"proposed appropriations\" as that term is used in the budget and accounting act of 1921, as amended, and must be justified by your agency. do not release agency justifications provided to omb and any agency future year plans or long-range estimates to anyone outside the executive branch, except in accordance with this section. section 51.16 confirms and clarifies the application of this section to pre-decisional, deliberative budget information relating to the inspectors general. 22.2 congressional testimony and communications the executive branch communications that led to the president\\'s budgetary decisions will not be disclosed either by the agencies or by those who have prepared the budget. in addition, agency justifications provided to omb and any agency future year plans or long-range estimates will not be furnished to anyone outside the executive branch, except in accordance with this section. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 1 of section 22 section 22‚Äîcommunications with the congress and the public and clearance requirements when furnishing information on appropriations and budgetary matters, you (and your agency representatives) must be aware of the following limitation on communications: \"...an officer or employee of an agency may submit to congress or a committee of congress an appropriations estimate or request, a request for an increase in that estimate or request, or a recommendation on meeting the financial needs of the government only when requested by either house of congress\" (31 u.s.c. ¬ß 1108(e)). you must also be aware of restrictions on communications to influence legislation that are not conducted through proper official channels (18 u.s.c. ¬ß 1913). after formal transmittal of the budget, an amendment, or a supplemental appropriations request, the following policies apply when testifying before any congressional committee or communicating with members of the congress: ‚Ä¢ witnesses will give frank and complete answers to all questions. ‚Ä¢ witnesses will avoid volunteering personal opinions that reflect positions inconsistent with the president\\'s program or appropriation request. ‚Ä¢ if statutory provisions exist for the direct submission of the agency budget request to the congress, omb may provide you additional materials supporting the president\\'s budget request that you will forward to the congress with the agency testimony. witnesses will be prepared to explain the agency submission, the request in the president\\'s budget, and any justification material. ‚Ä¢ when responding to specific questions on program and appropriations requests, witnesses will not provide the agency\\'s request to omb or plans for the use of appropriations that exceed the president\\'s request. typically, witnesses are responsible for one or a few programs, whereas the president is responsible for all the needs of the federal government. where appropriate, witnesses will explain this difference in perspective and that it is therefore not appropriate for them to support appropriations above the president\\'s request. ‚Ä¢ when asked to provide a written response that involves a statement of opinion on program and appropriations requests, witnesses will provide a reply through the agency head. ‚Ä¢ do not let your communications be perceived as an \"appropriations estimate or request ... or an increase in that estimate or request\" (31 u.s.c. ¬ß 1108). you are expected to support the president\\'s budgetary decisions and seek adjustments to those decisions only through established procedures if your agency head determines such action is necessary. 22.3 clearance of materials for the congress and the media policy consistency between the president\\'s budget and the budget-related materials prepared for the congress and the media is essential. to ensure this consistency, you are required to submit budget-related materials to omb for clearance prior to transmittal to congressional committees, individual members of the congress or their staff, or the media. unless a specific exemption is approved by omb, materials subject to omb clearance include: ‚Ä¢ all budget justifications and budget-related oversight materials; ‚Ä¢ testimony before and letters to congressional committees; page 2 of section 22 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 22‚Äîcommunications with the congress and the public and clearance requirements ‚Ä¢ written responses to congressional inquiries or other materials for the record; ‚Ä¢ materials responding to committee and subcommittee reporting requirements; ‚Ä¢ capability statements; ‚Ä¢ appeals letters; ‚Ä¢ reprogramming requests; ‚Ä¢ related cost information; ‚Ä¢ financial management documents addressing budget and policy issues (e.g., some accountability reports or transmittal documents for audited financial statements); and ‚Ä¢ proposed press releases relating to the president\\'s budget. provide this information to omb as far in advance as feasible and no less than five working days in advance to allow adequate review time. performance and accountability reports must be provided 10 days in advance unless a shorter period is approved by omb. omb review of reprogramming requests may take longer in some circumstances (e.g., if the request has not been coordinated or if supporting materials have not been provided concurrently). in exceptional circumstances, where the response time is very short, agencies may request oral clearance or make other arrangements for expedited review. immediately after the budget transmittal and after subsequent transmittals, provide omb with a schedule of anticipated congressional reviews that require agency oral and written participation. revise this schedule as appropriate. address any questions you have about this subsection to the omb representatives whom you normally consult on budget-related matters. 22.4 clearance of changes to the president\\'s budget if you want to propose changes to the president\\'s budget (e.g., appropriations language, limitations, balance sheets required by the government corporation control act, and dollar amounts), you must follow the confidentiality and clearance guidance provided in this section and submit a written request as described in section 110.3. omb will notify you whether a formal transmittal of the change will be made. when it is possible to reduce the amount of an appropriations request before action has been taken by the appropriations committee of either house, the head of your agency must inform omb promptly. before your agency head decides to request restoration of a reduction, the reasons for the reduction, the circumstances under which it was made, and its significance to the president\\'s program should be carefully considered. 22.5 information available to the public agency budget documents that are subject to the freedom of information act (foia) may be exempt from mandatory release pursuant to 5 u.s.c. ¬ß 552(b)(5). depending on the nature of the record requested, other foia exemptions may apply. when deciding whether to withhold a budget document that is exempt from mandatory release, follow the foia memorandum issued by the president on january 21, 2009 and the foia guidance issued by the attorney general on march 19, 2009. any discretionary decision by an omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 3 of section 22 section 22‚Äîcommunications with the congress and the public and clearance requirements agency to disclose protected information should be made only after full and deliberate consideration of the institutional interests that could be implicated by disclosure, as well as after consultation with omb. agency heads are responsible for determining the propriety of record releases under foia. certain agencies headed by a collegial body are required to hold their meetings open to public observation unless the agency properly determines that the matter to be discussed warrants the closing of those meetings for reasons enumerated in the government in the sunshine act (5 u.s.c. ¬ß 552b). some meetings covered by that act may pertain to budgetary information discussed in this circular. although, as with the foia, it is not possible to determine merely by the generic category of such information whether such an agency would be authorized to close a particular meeting covered by the act, agencies must review those situations that involve budgetary information under the guidelines in the paragraph above and 5 u.s.c. ¬ß 552b(c). such agencies are responsible for the propriety of determinations under these guidelines and provisions. 22.6 congressional budget justifications congressional budget justification materials must include or be structured as the performance plan submission (section 240). in addition, agencies must include the additional information described below, as well as detailed descriptions of agencies\\' activities and proposals at the program, project, and activity level. (a) materials for performance plan submission to the congress consult with your congressional representatives to agree on the performance plan format prior to submitting your congressional justification. please also note the applicable public posting and notification requirements that apply to performance plans as detailed in section 22.6(c). your omb representative should be included in those consultations as appropriate. accordingly, your omb representative should be provided with your proposed justification to the congress with sufficient time for review. (b) material to be included in congressional budget justifications consistent with 41 u.s.c. ¬ß 1703(h), identify funding levels requested for education and training of the acquisition workforce in your budget justifications to the congress. consistent with 42 u.s.c. ¬ß 8255, identify funds requested for energy conservation measures in your budget justifications to the congress. agencies should develop, for online posting in fy 2021, machine-readable (csv, xml, tsv, or json) file(s) for the budget summary table(s) that normally accompany the congressional budget justification, including footnotes (please see section 220.22 for a definition of machine-readable format). please work with your omb representative on timelines and plans for preparing this machine readable information. agencies are reminded of the reporting requirements of the good accounting obligation in government act (public law 115-414). this act requires agencies to include, in their congressional budget justifications, information on recommendations from the government accountability office and the office of inspector general of the agency. information on outstanding gao and ig recommendations is available from agency offices of inspectors general, gao.gov, or oversight.gov. provide the congress with information to assess current and proposed capital projects that is consistent with the administration\\'s budget proposals, including: appropriate information on planning; budgeting, including the current or proposed use of incremental or full funding; acquisition; and management of the projects. page 4 of section 22 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 22‚Äîcommunications with the congress and the public and clearance requirements you must submit all budget justification materials to omb for clearance before transmitting them to the congress. (c) availability of congressional budget justifications make your full congressional budget justification materials, including your performance plan submission, available to the public and post the materials on the internet at a vanity url (for example agencyxyz.gov/cj) within two weeks after transmittal of those materials to the congress. release of these materials must be done in accordance with the requirements of this section and any relevant provisions of law. materials will not be released if disclosure is prohibited by statute, the materials are classified or must be kept secret in the interest of national security or foreign policy, or the materials are otherwise exempt from release pursuant to 5 u.s.c. ¬ß 552(b). omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 5 of section 22 circular no. a‚Äì11 part 2 preparation and submission of budget estimates executive office of the president office of management and budget december 2019 section 25‚Äîsummary of requirements section 25‚Äîsummary of requirements table of contents 25.1 does part 2 (preparation and submission of budget estimates) apply to me?

by law (31 u.s.c. 1104), the president\\'s budget must include information on all agencies of all three branches of the federal government. therefore, the instructions in part 2 generally apply to all government agencies. in addition, these instructions apply to the district of columbia, which must submit information in support of federal payments to the district. omb includes the information submitted by certain agencies in the budget without change. in addition, government-sponsored enterprises (gses) submit some of the information required of government agencies on a comparable basis, and omb includes it in the budget for information purposes. if your agency appears in the following list, it is not subject to executive branch review by law or custom. that means that the requirements for submitting materials in support of your budget request do not apply to you. however, you do need to submit the information required for inclusion in the budget database and documents, which omb incorporates without revision. ‚Ä¢ legislative branch agencies. ‚Ä¢ judicial branch agencies. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (revised‚Äîdecember 2019) page 1 of section 25 section 25‚Äîsummary of requirements ‚Ä¢ executive branch agencies, as follows: ‚Ä¢ milk, fruit, and vegetable marketing orders, usda. ‚Ä¢ international trade commission. ‚Ä¢ postal service. ‚Ä¢ board of governors of the federal reserve system. ‚Ä¢ government-sponsored enterprises (gses) as follows: ‚Ä¢ federal national mortgage association. ‚Ä¢ federal home loan mortgage corporation. ‚Ä¢ banks for cooperatives. ‚Ä¢ agriculture credit banks. ‚Ä¢ farm credit banks. ‚Ä¢ federal agricultural mortgage corporation. ‚Ä¢ federal home loan banks. ‚Ä¢ financing corporation. ‚Ä¢ resolution funding corporation. contact your omb representative if you have questions about the applicability of these instructions. 25.2 how do i get an exception? for the sake of comparability among the budget data and presentations, omb does not grant many exceptions to the specific requirements in this part. however, if you believe special circumstances warrant an exception in your case, submit a written request detailing the circumstances and the specific exception needed to your omb representative by august 1. if omb approves the exception, it is valid only for the specified budget. 25.3 for what items do i need advance approval? you must get advance approval from your omb representative for the items shown in the table below. item see section... timing (1) form and content of justification materials. 51.2 to be determined in consultation with your omb representative. (2) program activity structure in the program and financing schedule. 82.5 by october 1. (3) changes in functional and receipt classifications. 79.4 by october 1. (4) changes in budget account structure (new accounts, merged accounts, changes in account titles, etc.). 79.4 by october 1 or as soon as possible thereafter for changes dependent on congressional action or other circumstances beyond agency control. 25.4 how do i submit information to omb? you generally submit information in two stages: (1) as part of your budget request. both executive branch agencies that are subject to executive branch review and the district of columbia must prepare information and materials supporting their budget request. your omb representative will work with you to determine the specific form, content, page 2 of section 25 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (revised‚Äîdecember 2019) section 25‚Äîsummary of requirements and timing of this information. agencies that are not subject to executive branch review are not required to submit this information. (2) after passback. passback usually occurs around the end of november. in early-mid november, omb issues detailed guidance and deadlines to complete cy and by information. this stage includes max computer data, print materials, and additional information used to prepare the budget documents and supporting database. also, you may need to revise and resubmit some materials included in the budget request to reflect the effects of final decisions. agencies that are not subject to executive branch review need to submit information for inclusion in the budget documents and the budget database. in the following sections, we tell you more about each stage, the items required, the criteria for determining whether the item applies to your agency, and where to find more detailed guidance on the item. 25.5 what do i include in the budget request to omb? you should include the information described below. in addition, your omb representative may require you to include other materials (for example, information about your budget request by account and budget enforcement act (bea) category). table 1: contents of the budget request1 if your agency is subject to then include this... see section or link‚Ä¶ executive branch review and... justification materials 51 has motor vehicles motor vehicle fleet report instructions (due august 27, 2019, initial agency input) obligates more than $5 million annually space budget justification 54 for rental payments to gsa or others (due with agency budget submission) has credit liquidating accounts with justification of unobligated balances in 51.14, 185.3(l) unobligated balances that carry over into liquidating accounts the current year has geospatial data investments $100,000 information on geospatial data instructions or greater investments2 (due within 90 days of enactment of an agency\\'s appropriations bill) has technology transfers information on technology transfers instructions (due january 31, 2020) subject to gpra requirements performance budget 51.7, 200 is requesting funds for information general guidance on it budget instructions technology submissions, including: it portfolio summary (comprised of the it investment portfolio summary, provisioned it services spending summary, data center spending summary, and budget accounts summary), and submission of major it investment business cases. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (revised‚Äîdecember 2019) page 3 of section 25 section 25‚Äîsummary of requirements table 1: contents of the budget request1 if your agency is subject to executive branch review and... then include this... see section or link‚Ä¶ is requesting funds for information technology it statements and it table 51.3 is requesting funds for non-information technology (it) capital assets (other than aircraft) business case for non-it capital acquisitions2 instructions is requesting funds for acquisition and maintenance of aircraft business case for acquisition and maintenance of aircraft2 instructions is proposing any discretionary administrative actions that would increase mandatory spending information on planned administrative actions omb memorandum m-20-06, 31.3 provides major formula grants to state or local governments state-by-state data and other information (due after passback) instructions 1 materials are due september 9, 2019, unless otherwise specified. requirements do not apply to agencies not subject to executive branch review (see section 25.1). 2 if final decisions require changes to this information, revised materials must be submitted. 25.6 how do i build the max database? (a) overview after the president has considered the estimates and made his decisions, you will be notified. you submit two types of information after passback, as explained in more detail in the following sections: ‚Ä¢ max data, submitted through the max budget data system (see sections 79-86). ‚Ä¢ print materials, which omb uses to prepare parts of the budget appendix (see section 95). if the decisions affect other budget accounts (such as the amount of transfers), you need to coordinate these changes with whomever is responsible for the budget submission of those other accounts. when you are informed of the president\\'s decisions, your agency head will determine the best and most appropriate distribution of amounts that have been left flexible. this circular does not address the process by which you appeal passback decisions. we issue separate guidance on the appeals process at the time of passback. (b) timing the core information in the py column must be completed by mid-november (see key dates). in mid- early november omb issues detailed guidance and deadlines for completing all max database schedules. these deadlines are based on the very tight schedule that omb must maintain in order to transmit the budget in a timely manner. in order to meet the deadlines, you must begin providing the required information based on passback decisions. do not wait until you have resolved appeals. appeals generally affect very little of the information you submit, and you will have an opportunity to change the information as necessary to reflect the appeal resolution. unless your omb representative agrees, do not submit page 4 of section 25 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (revised‚Äîdecember 2019) section 25‚Äîsummary of requirements information that assumes an appeal resolution different from passback. when an appeal results in changes to passback decisions, the changes often differ from the agency proposal. (c) max data you must submit the max computer data described below for each applicable budget account. in addition, if the criterion listed in the first column of the table applies to you, submit the data described in the second column for each applicable budget account. we indicate the max data schedule or schedules involved and tell you where to find guidance on the requirement. table 2: max data 1,2 if your agency has‚Ä¶ then submit for each applicable budget account‚Ä¶ max data schedule‚Ä¶ see section‚Ä¶ budget authority and outlays estimates of budget authority and outlays character classification data, including r&d data program and financing schedules3 x c x 81, 82 84 82 obligations object classification schedules o 83 employment employment summary q 85.6 receipt accounts receipt estimates k and r 81.3(b) credit liquidating or financing accounts; or non-credit revolving funds that conduct business-type activities (as determined by omb), including gses balance sheet f 86.1 appropriations language requests budget year appropriations requests in thousands of dollars t 86.2 major trust funds and certain other accounts (as determined by omb) status of funds j 86.3 special or trust fund receipts special and trust fund receipts n 86.4 credit programs federal credit data g, h, u, and y 185 1 including agencies not subject to executive branch review. gses submit data for schedules f, g, and h only. federal reserve board submits data for schedules a, p, and o only. 2 information required for schedules a, s, and p will be reported in a single worksheet (schedule x). 3 schedule p also required for accounts with obligated or unobligated balances.

(ii) supplemental proposals. you should make every effort to conduct your programs within the amounts appropriated for the current year and to postpone actions that require supplemental appropriations. omb will only consider supplemental requests that meet the criteria provided in section 110. (2) presidential policy outyear estimates. policy estimates for the nine years following the budget year (by+1 through by+9) enable an analysis of the long-term consequences of proposed program or tax policy initiatives. when you develop outyear policy estimates, they should be consistent with the general policies and information required for the budget year and indicate the degree to which specific policy decisions made for the budget year or any subsequent year affect budget authority, outlay, and receipt outyear levels. for mandatory estimates, take into consideration changes in spending trends, economic assumptions, and other actions or events when you prepare estimates of budget authority, outlays, and receipts for by+1 through by+9. for discretionary budget authority estimates, unless directed otherwise, assume that max will generate the outyears using current inflation factors. (b) what economic assumptions should i use when i develop estimates? all budget materials, including those for the outyear policy and baseline estimates, must be consistent with the economic assumptions provided by omb. the specific guidance below applies to outyear policy estimates. omb policy permits consideration of price changes for goods and services as a factor in developing estimates. however, this does not mean that you should automatically include an allowance for the full rate of anticipated inflation in your request. for mandatory programs, reflect the full inflation rate where such an allowance is required by law and there has been no decision to propose less than required. for discretionary programs, you may include an allowance for the full rate of anticipated inflation, an allowance for less than the full rate, or even no allowance for inflation. in many cases, you must make trade-offs between budgeting increases for inflation versus other increases for programmatic purposes. unless omb determines otherwise, you must prepare your budget requests to omb within the budget planning guidance levels provided to you, regardless of the effect of inflation. economic assumptions may be revised shortly before final budget decisions are made. these revisions will not usually result in changes to the previous budget guidance on your agency totals. see sections 32 and 85 for personnel assumptions and costs. page 2 of section 31 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (revised‚Äîdecember 2019) section 31‚Äîpolicies, laws, and other general requirements for budget estimates 31.2 advance appropriations do not request advance appropriations if the only purpose is to shift budget authority for a program that would normally be provided in the budget year. for example, if you would normally request budget authority in the budget year to cover a cohort of obligations for a grant program, even though some of the obligations will not be incurred until the following fiscal year, you may not request an advance appropriation to cover the obligations expected to be incurred in the following fiscal year. 31.3 administrative paygo administrative paygo is a budget neutrality requirement for executive branch discretionary administrative actions affecting net mandatory spending. this requirement is established in executive order 13893 increasing government accountability for administrative actions by reinvigorating administrative paygo and additional implementation guidance is available to agencies in omb memorandum m-20-06 and budget procedures memorandum 986. e.o 13893 requires agencies to submit proposed administrative actions to omb for administrative paygo review. in addition, you are required to include with your budget submission a list of all planned or anticipated administrative actions that would increase mandatory spending (see section 25.5). 31.4 equal opportunity your estimates should reflect the administration\\'s commitment to programs designed to ensure or promote equal opportunity regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), disability, age, sexual orientation, genetic information, or any other non-merit-based factor. these activities include the following: implementation of statutes or regulations requiring fair housing; nondiscrimination in federally assisted or conducted programs; equal credit opportunity; full voting rights; civil and constitutional rights; equal employment opportunity (including nondiscrimination by federal agencies); and efforts to increase federal contracting and subcontracting opportunities for minorities, women, and disadvantaged entrepreneurs. 31.5 full funding requests for acquisition of capital assets must propose full funding to cover the full costs of the project or a useful segment of the project, consistent with the policy stated in the capital programming guide. specifically, requests for procurement programs must provide for full funding of the entire cost. in addition, requests for construction programs must provide for full funding of the complete cost of construction. you should not submit estimates for construction funds for major construction projects unless planning will reach a point by the end of the current year that will ensure that a contract for construction could be awarded during the budget year. remember that administration policy and the antideficiency act require you to have sufficient budget authority or other budgetary resources to cover the full amount of unconditional obligations under any contract. additionally, agencies must comply with the recording statute (31 u.s.c. 1501). for policies related to leases of capital assets and lease-purchases, see section 31.9 and appendix b. for guidance on budget submissions for capital asset acquisitions, see section 51.19. for guidance on principles and techniques of planning, budgeting, procurement, and management of capital assets, see the supplement to this circular, the capital programming guide. 31.6 government perquisites omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (revised‚Äîdecember 2019) page 3 of section 31 section 31‚Äîpolicies, laws, and other general requirements for budget estimates your estimates should reflect administration policy to limit the use of government vehicles, government aircraft, travel, executive dining facilities, conferences, real property, and fleet management in accordance with bulletin no. 93-11 \"fiscal responsibility and reducing perquisites.\" 31.7 multi-year appropriations consider whether it is appropriate to request appropriations with multi-year availability, particularly for buildings, equipment, and other types of fixed capital assets, including major computer and telecommunications systems, with long acquisition cycles. where multi-year appropriations requests are appropriate, you should match the period of availability to the expected length of the acquisition cycle. 31.8 management improvement initiatives and policies your estimates should reflect your efforts and planned action to strengthen management and improve program performance. guidance on specific areas is provided below. ‚Ä¢ capital planning and investment control. agency estimates should reflect the administration\\'s commitment to information technology (it) investments that directly support agency missions as identified in the agency\\'s information resources management (irm) strategic plan, specified in omb circular a-130, which should fully describe all it resources at the agency, be prepared in a manner consistent with the cio role and cio review described on page 11 of omb memorandum m-15-14 management and oversight of federal it, including the certification statements described in section 51.3, and be consistent with the federal it acquisition reform act (fitara) and other relevant laws as described by instructions in sections 51.19 and 55. ‚Ä¢ open data and records management. your estimates should reflect data sets that have been prioritized through your agency\\'s engagement with customers as specified in omb memorandum m-13-13 \"open data policy ‚Äì managing information as an asset.\" your estimates should also reflect work necessary to meet the requirements of omb memorandum m-12-18 \"managing government records directive,\" omb circular a-130, the e-government act, and omb\\'s guidance. initiatives should create a customer-centered electronic presence (maximizing the reuse of current assets) and advancing the strategy identified in the irm plan. ‚Ä¢ security. your estimates should reflect a comprehensive understanding of omb security policies, such as omb circular a-130, and national institute of standards and technology (nist) guidance, including compliance with the federal information security modernization act, and omb memorandum m-17-05, \"fiscal year 2016-2017 guidance on federal information security and privacy management requirements,\" by: ‚Ä¢ reflecting the cost considerations used to calculate it security costs (see section 51.19);

and ‚Ä¢ demonstrating how the agency ensures the effective use of security and privacy controls, as well as authentication tools to protect privacy for those systems that promote or permit public access. ‚Ä¢ privacy. your estimates should reflect the administration\\'s commitment to privacy and consistent with omb circular a-130, should include a description of your agency\\'s privacy program and the resources required to ensure compliance with applicable privacy requirements, develop and evaluate privacy policy, and manage privacy risks. at a minimum, your estimate should: ‚Ä¢ demonstrate that your agency is aware of applicable privacy requirements and has fully assessed the cost to the agency for ensuring compliance with those requirements and managing privacy risks; ‚Ä¢ reflect the consideration of your agency\\'s inventory of information systems that create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, disclose, or dispose of personally identifiable information; and ‚Ä¢ reflect the consideration of your privacy continuous monitory strategy and the resources and associated costs required to ensure that privacy controls are effectively monitored on an ongoing basis at an assessment frequency sufficient to ensure compliance with applicable privacy requirements and to manage privacy risks. ‚Ä¢ improper payments. your estimates should reflect anticipated reductions in improper payments as reported in the performance and accountability report pursuant to the improper payments information act of 2002, as amended by the improper payments elimination and recovery act of 2010 (ipera) and the improper payments elimination and recovery improvement act of 2012 (iperia). ‚Ä¢ systems modernization projects. for either implementation or planning activities for areas in which there is a pre-designated/designated quality service management office, specifically, core financial management, grants management, cybersecurity, and civilian human resources transaction services, reflect plans to achieve compliance with omb memorandum m-19-26, ‚Äúcentralized mission support capabilities for the federal government‚Äù and other guidance as appropriate including, m-10-26, \"immediate review of financial systems it projects,\" appendix d to omb circular a-123, \"compliance with the federal financial management improvement act of 1996,\" and use data from readiness assessments for such planning activities. ‚Ä¢ other contributions. your estimates should reflect the required contributions to e-gov line of business and other shared service operations. contribution information is posted in the e-gov funding tool. 31.9 construction, leases of capital assets, and acquisition of real property agencies are required to submit certain types of leases and other unique, non-routine financing proposals to omb for review of the scoring impact. see appendix b for specific requirements. (a) construction of federal facilities if you are proposing construction of federal facilities, you must: ‚Ä¢ comply with executive order 12088 for pollution control standards; omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (revised‚Äîdecember 2019) page 5 of section 31 section 31‚Äîpolicies, laws, and other general requirements for budget estimates ‚Ä¢ include the amounts required to ensure that existing facilities provide safe and healthful workplaces for federal employees consistent with the standards promulgated under section 19 of the occupational safety and health act of 1970, the provisions of executive order 12196, and the related safety and health provisions for federal employees of the secretary of labor (29 cfr, chapter xvii, part 1960); ‚Ä¢ comply with requirements of the architectural barriers act of 1968 to eliminate structural barriers impeding the mobility of individuals with disabilities; ‚Ä¢ have reviewed the gsa inventory of federal facilities and indicate the reasons you want to acquire new space instead of using existing federal space, according to the gsa inventory; ‚Ä¢ comply with executive orders 11988 and 11990 if you are proposing to use sites located in floodplains or wetlands; and ‚Ä¢ comply with any applicable requirements of executive order 13834 regarding efficient federal operations. buildings that meet green building certification requirements are to be reported annually in the federal real property profile, which captures information on federal real property. agency users can access general information about the federal real property profile at http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104199. in addition to the requirements above, if you are requesting funds in support of capital facilities projects, including new construction, full and partial building renovation/modernization, or facility investments that meet the agency\\'s capital threshold, you must provide the following information upon request by your omb program examiner: ‚Ä¢ documentation supporting compliance with the capital programming guide and section 55, and the agency\\'s capital planning and investment control (cpic) process. ‚Ä¢ life cycle cost analysis consistent with circular a-94. ‚Ä¢ housing plan indicating at a minimum the fte to be housed and the types of facility space and associated square footage for each type, and the utilization rate for all space and if applicable, office space as a subset of all space. ‚Ä¢ environmental/energy efficiency analyses, including current and future consumption estimates for renovation/modernization. ‚Ä¢ any additional documentation requested by the omb program examiner. (b) construction of federally-owned housing if you are proposing to construct federally-owned housing, make sure you: ‚Ä¢ do not include estimated funding for construction of housing for civilian employees, except where necessary to maintain continuity and efficiency of service and where private capital cannot be found; and ‚Ä¢ meet the requirements in omb circular a‚Äì45 for service or protection, or lack of available housing. page 6 of section 31 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (revised‚Äîdecember 2019) section 31‚Äîpolicies, laws, and other general requirements for budget estimates (c) construction in the district of columbia you must consult the commission of fine arts regarding plans for the construction of buildings and other structures in the district of columbia that may affect in any important way the appearance of the city, and other questions involving artistic considerations with which the federal government is concerned. (d) acquisition of land in the national capital area you must consult with the national capital planning commission in advance regarding proposed developments and projects or commitments for the acquisition of land in the national capital area, in accordance with 40 u.s.c. 8723(a) (see http://www.ncpc.gov). (e) leasing capital assets if you propose to lease capital assets rather than purchase them, you should check the requirements in omb circular a‚Äì94. for additional information on the budgetary treatment of leases, see appendix b. (f) real property acquisition if you plan to acquire real property, you must: ‚Ä¢ include estimates consistent with the policies of executive orders 13327 and 13834 in your budget submission; and ‚Ä¢ make sure that estimates for acquisition of real property under contract are consistent with obligations reported in object class 32 (see section 83.7). 31.10 hospital costs if you are developing estimates for hospital costs: ‚Ä¢ use data based on the use of resources allocated by diagnosis-related groups and compare these data with payment rates of other payers using similar groupings; ‚Ä¢ indicate whether or not capital and depreciation costs are contained, and describe the cost allocation method underlying the data; and ‚Ä¢ identify the amount of reimbursement collected from third parties and federal agencies if you provide hospital care on a reimbursable basis. if you provide estimates for inpatient care facilities and medical care services, make sure they are consistent with executive order 12372. 31.11 advisory committees and interagency groups if you have advisory committees and interagency groups: ‚Ä¢ reflect the results of the committee reviews required by executive order 12838, which requires agencies to reduce the number and cost of non-statutory advisory committees; ‚Ä¢ use the ceilings established by omb circular a‚Äì135; and omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (revised‚Äîdecember 2019) page 7 of section 31 section 31‚Äîpolicies, laws, and other general requirements for budget estimates ‚Ä¢ separately identify the costs of advisory committees established by statute that you are proposing for termination. you are prohibited from financing interagency groups (including boards (except federal executive boards), commissions, councils, committees, and similar groups) by contributions from member agencies\\' appropriations by a government-wide general provision unless such financing is specifically authorized by statute. therefore, you must propose financing for such groups in the budget in one of the following forms: ‚Ä¢ appropriations specifically for the interagency group. ‚Ä¢ specific language authorizing interagency funding. 31.12 radio spectrum-dependent communications-electronics systems the value of radio spectrum required for radio spectrum-dependent communications-electronics systems should be considered, in economic analyses of alternative systems/solutions.1 in some cases, greater investments in systems could enhance federal spectrum efficiency (e.g., purchase of more expensive radios that use less bandwidth); in other cases, the desired service could be met through other forms of supply (e.g., private wireless services or use of land lines). therefore, to identify solutions that have the highest net benefits, agencies should consider greater investment to increase spectrum efficiency along with cost minimizing strategies. to this end, section 6411 of the middle class tax relief and job creation act directed that a‚Äì11 be updated with sections (a) and (c). subsection (b) provides a methodology for determining a baseline to evaluate improvements in spectrum efficiency. (a) guidance for determining value of spectrum-dependent assets to ensure the federal government demonstrates proper stewardship of the spectrum resource in its procurement decisions, and thus yield improvements in overall federal spectrum management and use, agencies must include in the development of their budget justifications for procurement of major radio spectrum-dependent communications-electronics systems consideration of the economic value of the spectrum being used.2 the extent of economic and budget analysis required will depend upon the nature and value of the systems and spectrum involved, and agencies should work with their omb contacts to ensure a proper level of analysis is conducted.3 to demonstrate consideration of the value of the relevant spectrum, agencies should indicate whether the system procured was the most spectrum \"efficient\" solution among those qualified bids (i.e., that met specified mission/operational requirements); if an agency is unable to so indicate, then the agency should indicate the investment difference between the solution chosen and the more spectrum \"efficient\" qualified solution. to further advance federal stewardship of the spectrum resource, agencies should also include the following in their budget justifications for procurement of major radio spectrum-dependent communications-electronics systems: 1 circular a‚Äì11 reflects language recommended by the commerce spectrum management advisory committee, pursuant to section 6411 of the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2012. 2 agencies should work with their omb contacts to identify the new and/or existing systems that will use the a‚Äì11 methodology to determine the economic value of spectrum use. agencies should give priority to systems that operate or plan to operate in frequencies below 3 gigahertz that have been identified by the national telecommunications and information administration for potential repurposing to commercial use and those that have primary status within a particular band. 3 as a starting point, agencies should estimate the economic value of spectrum utilized by a system using the methodology included in subsection (b). page 8 of section 31 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (revised‚Äîdecember 2019) section 31‚Äîpolicies, laws, and other general requirements for budget estimates ‚Ä¢ in a request for proposal (rfp)4 to procure the system, the requirement that respondents address spectrum \"efficiency\" factors (e.g., greater adjacent band compatibility, less use of bandwidth, etc.) and assess trade-offs between investment in equipment and spectrum requirements. ‚Ä¢ whether the system will share spectrum with other federal or non-federal systems/operations and, if so, the nature and extent of the sharing relationship. ‚Ä¢ when proposing a new system, whether using an existing or alternative federal system to meet the capability requirement is possible, or whether using capabilities of similar federal users has been considered. ‚Ä¢ when replacing systems, what improvements in spectrum \"efficiency\" and \"effectiveness\" exist compared to the prior system. ‚Ä¢ certification of consideration of non-spectrum dependent or commercial alternatives to meet mission/operational requirements. spectrum should be considered to have value and be included, to the extent practical, in economic analyses of alternative systems/solutions. in some cases, greater investments in systems could enhance federal system spectrum efficiency (e.g., purchase of radios that use less bandwidth); in other cases, the desired service can be met with other forms of supply (e.g., private wireless services or use of land lines). in addition to considering cost minimizing strategies, agencies are encouraged to consider whether the investment would provide net benefits. (b) methodology for determining a baseline to evaluate improvements in efficiency the purpose of this section is to provide a methodology to evaluate relative spectrum efficiency when considering alternatives for procuring systems, as called for by subsection (a), or when evaluating spectrum usage generally. the methodology does not attempt to measure or judge the overall benefits of a federal activity that utilizes spectrum-dependent systems to achieve mission functions nor does it attempt to establish a dollar value or auction price. instead, the method outlined in this section provides agencies a way to evaluate improvements in spectrum efficiency in implementing their required and essential activities. also, agencies may develop alternative methods for measuring spectrum efficiency and submit them to omb for approval. one method for determining spectrum efficiency when assessing procurement of federal systems is to develop a baseline that measures: 1) the technical characteristics of the frequency used by the system, 2) the population of an area where spectrum is utilized, 3) the size of the spectrum frequency band or bands used, and 4) the percentage of overall spectrum capacity utilized within that band or bands. the following method can be used to determine a score in these terms that agencies may use in their procurement processes and budget documents as required in subsection (a)5: 1. determine a weighting factor to assign to frequency used. agencies should use table 1 to assign a weighting factor to the frequency utilized by the system. table 1: example frequency weighting factors 4 any efficiency factors included in rfp respondents\\' proposal that are selected should also be included as terms of the final contracts. 5 subsection (a) reflects language recommended by the commerce spectrum management advisory committee, which is being included in a‚Äì11 pursuant to section 6411 of the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2012. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (revised‚Äîdecember 2019) page 9 of section 31 section 31‚Äîpolicies, laws, and other general requirements for budget estimates frequency (mhz) weighting factors 0-500 0.05 500-2999 1.00 3000-5999 0.50 6000 and above 0.10 2. estimate population impacted by federal use. agencies should estimate the u.s. population in the service area where the federal system will be used. agencies should use u.s. census bureau population information by metropolitan statistical area (msa) or other relevant designation for non-metropolitan areas to develop estimates. systems that operate partially in the u.s. should only count the u.s. population impacted. for example, a system that only operates in denver and does not utilize spectrum outside of the denver msa, should only use the population information for the denver msa in estimating population affected. conversely, agencies should use population information for the entire country, if a system is assigned or utilizes spectrum nationwide. 3. estimate percentage of the spectrum frequency band used by a federal system. agencies should identify the percentage of bandwidth utilized by a federal system. this percentage should include the total amount of bandwidth needed to operate the system in terms of megahertz divided by the total available spectrum (in megahertz) available for the system, regardless of whether that spectrum is necessary to support transmitting or receiving equipment. if more than one band will be used, the percentage should include the total amount of bandwidth needed in each band, divided by the total available spectrum across all bands used. to the extent possible this calculation should include necessary guard bands. estimate percentage of overall spectrum capacity utilized. within those spectrum bands used by a federal system, agencies should identify the percentage of overall spectrum capacity utilized. this may be done by estimating the average percentage of time in a day when the federal system is expected to operate, by estimating the average percentage of the total data capacity within that band the federal system is expected to use, or both. for each frequency assignment agencies are required to provide estimated time of use based on the guidance provided in table 2. table 2: guidance on time of use frequency of actual use percentage of time used per day constant or nearly constant 50 to 100 regular/frequent 10 to 50 intermittent 1 to 10 sporadic/occasional less than 1 multiply the frequency weighting factor by population, frequency bandwidth, and utilization. to calculate the baseline to evaluate spectrum efficiency improvements, multiply together the preceding four factors. the product provides a baseline that can be used to evaluate the extent of efficiency gains, as discussed in subsection (a). when comparing to systems with the same capability, a higher weighting would be considered less efficient. (c) spectrum certification page 10 of section 31 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (revised‚Äîdecember 2019) section 31‚Äîpolicies, laws, and other general requirements for budget estimates you must obtain a certification by the national telecommunications and information administration (ntia) of the department of commerce, or your agency as designated by ntia, that the radio frequencies required can be made available before you submit estimates for the development or procurement of major radio spectrum-dependent communication-electronics systems. the ntia, which is responsible for assigning spectrum to federal users, may also review these analyses, during the assignment process.6 31.13 spectrum relocation fund relocation or modification of systems subject to commercial spectrum enhancement act. for agencies that are affected by the reallocation of certain frequencies from federal to commercial use, the commercial spectrum enhancement act (csea, p.l. 108‚Äì494, as amended by p.l. 112-96) streamlines the process for funding the relocation or modification of systems and, for certain reallocations after february 2012, for funding spectrum sharing (as well as relocation). auction receipts from the sale of eligible frequencies will be deposited into the spectrum relocation fund (srf), unless otherwise directed by statute, and these funds will be used to facilitate federal agencies\\' relocation or sharing. the federal communications commission (fcc) concluded an auction in january 2015 for licenses in the 1695-1710 mhz and 1755‚Äì1780 mhz bands, which are eligible frequency bands under the csea, as amended, along with the non-federal 2155-2180 mhz band (collectively, the aws-3 bands). under the amended csea, agency reimbursements from the srf for these bands are proceeding in a similar manner as occurred for previous eligible bands, with two main changes. first, agencies may recover for certain pre-auction costs, including through pre-auction transfers, if identified in the agency\\'s transition plan. agencies\\' requests for aws-3 pre-auction funds were submitted to the congress in september 2014, and agencies became eligible for transfers from the srf for pre-auction costs in october 2014. second, agencies may recover costs for spectrum sharing, in addition to relocating or modifying systems. spectrum relocation funds have no-year authority, though agencies are expected to adhere to the timeframes approved by omb. in accordance with section 120, these funds must be apportioned at least annually prior to obligation, unless specifically exempted. agencies that receive funds from the srf will report their expenditures to omb, concurrent with input into an annual report to the congress to be submitted by the national telecommunications and information administration (ntia) of the department of commerce. further guidance will be forthcoming on reporting requirements. if potential cost over-runs or delays become apparent in any spectrum relocation project, omb and ntia should be notified in order to facilitate further review. under the terms of the csea, agencies may receive more than one transfer from the srf, subject to prior review and approval by omb, in consultation with ntia. if the subsequent transfer or transfers exceed 10 percent of the original transfer, omb will notify congress and the government accountability office, in accordance with the requirements of the csea. if transferred amounts exceed actual relocation costs, excess amounts will be returned to the srf immediately after ntia has notified the fcc that the agency\\'s relocation is complete. as pertains to other frequency bands to which the csea applies, the fcc will notify ntia at least 18 months prior to the auction of eligible frequencies. upon such notification, csea relocation processes will commence consistent with the act, as with the above implementation. 31.14 historically black colleges and universities as required by executive order 13532, which establishes the white house initiative on historically black colleges and universities (hbcus), affected agencies and executive departments must produce an annual 6 ntia may review the economic analyses of alternative systems/solutions at any point in the ntia authorization processes. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (revised‚Äîdecember 2019) page 11 of section 31 section 31‚Äîpolicies, laws, and other general requirements for budget estimates plan that establishes clear goals for how the agency or department intends to increase the capacity of hbcus to effectively compete for grants and contracts and to encourage hbcus to participate in federal programs. 31.15 controlled unclassified information agency estimates should reflect consideration of executive order 13556, controlled unclassified information (cui), and the policies issued by the national archives and records administration (nara), 32 cfr part 2002, \"controlled unclassified information,\" with an effective date of november 14, 2016, and cui notice 2016-01, \"implementation guidance for the controlled unclassified information program,\" september 14, 2016. the information security oversight office within nara was designated as the executive agent to implement the cui program that will eventually replace all existing sensitivebut- unclassified (sbu) information handling regimes (\"for official use only, \" etc.) across the executive branch. agency estimates should reflect: ‚Ä¢ the hiring of full-time employees and/or contractor support to implement and manage the cui program at headquarters, regional locations, and within component agencies; ‚Ä¢ the development and deployment of automated marking tools that will ensure the uniform application of cui markings as well as ensure the timely dissemination of cui to authorized recipients; ‚Ä¢ development of internal policies to phase-in and transition to the cui program; ‚Ä¢ the modification of agency incident reporting mechanisms and systems to include cui categories and requirements; ‚Ä¢ the modification and issuance of contracts and agreements to reflect the standards of the cui program; ‚Ä¢ development and implementation of training programs to inform affected employees of their responsibilities when handling cui basic and specified categories; ‚Ä¢ assessment and any transition of information systems which handle or are used to process cui to the moderate confidentiality impact value; ‚Ä¢ assessment and transition of physical environments as required for cui; and ‚Ä¢ development of an internal agency cui self-inspection program. 31.16 additional policies and requirements develop your budget estimates consistent with the following laws, rules, and policies: additional requirements type of program or expenditure policies and requirements activities covered by the coastal barrier resources act do not include any new federal expenditures or financial assistance prohibited by the coastal barrier resources act (public law 97‚Äì348). foreign currencies refer to guidelines in the treasury financial manual (vol. 1, part 2, chapter 3200 and vol. 1, part 4, chapter 9000) and the department of foreign affairs manual (volume 4, chapter 360). remedial environmental projects at federal facilities follow the policies in executive orders 12088, 13423 and 13514. page 12 of section 31 omb circular

amounts for official use of united states mail, package delivery, and/or private carrier service, including postage due. assume maximum use of available postage discounts. records storage include sufficient amounts for the costs of storing and servicing temporary and inactive records. space and related requirements include payments for space, structures and facilities, land, and building service provided by gsa and others. systems acquisitions follow the guidance in the capital programming guide. ensure that electronic and information technology acquisitions meet the requirements of section 508 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 and allow individuals with disabilities access to and use of data. travel minimize official travel. reflect the allowances authorized under the federal travel regulations issued by gsa or comparable regulations issued by the department of defense for travel of military personnel and by the department of state for foreign service personnel. tort claims do not include amounts for payment of tort claims unless a substantial volume of claims is presented regularly. water and sewer payments to the district of columbia include amounts for payment for water and sewer services. construction of nuclear reactors obtain a letter from the department of energy setting forth its recommendations before submitting estimates. contractor claims include amounts for reimbursement of the claims and judgment fund for the full amount paid from the fund on behalf of the agency during the past year. subsidies for medicare part d eligible individuals for qualified prescription drug coverage do not assume that agency prescription drug costs for the agency\\'s retirees and/or dependents will be reduced by the part d program. federal entities will not receive subsidies for part d eligible individuals for qualified prescription drug coverage through the retiree drug subsidy (rds) and federal entities will not administer‚Äîor have a third party administer‚Äîa prescription drug plan or medicare advantage prescription drug plan for their retirees and/or their dependents. administration policy is that federal government entities should not receive the medicare part d drug subsidies because this would result in the medicare trust fund cross-subsidizing other federal programs. the primary rationale for creating the part d rds was to encourage employers and unions to continue to provide prescription drug coverage to their medicare eligible retirees and their qualified dependents after the implementation of the part d program.

compensation in my budget request? personnel compensation (a) pay scales, bonuses, allowances, and awards. for the purpose of planning agency budget requests for the 2021 budget, agencies should not include a provisional estimate of the civilian pay raise for january 2021. agencies should consult with their omb representative on the provisional estimate for the military pay raise for january 2021. in making their final estimates for the 2021 budget, agencies should anticipate revising pay raise amounts after the president makes a pay raise decision. your omb representative will provide additional guidance during budget season. the pay guidance above will apply to the statutory pay systems (general schedule, foreign service, and veterans health administration), the executive schedule, the senior executive service (ses), and wage grade employees. you should be prepared to provide supporting detail on calculating pay costs, including separate identification of the wage base reflected in the submission. for compensation costs, you must explicitly justify any increases in average compensation for the budget year. in fy 2021 budget requests, agencies must provide the following information on agency-wide salary and awards spending: (1) an estimate of fy 2020 salary spending, excluding salary spending for senior executive service (ses), senior level (sl), and scientific or professional (st) positions, (2) an estimate of fy 2020 awards spending as a percent of fy 2020 non-ses/sl/st salary spending, and (3) the amount requested for fy 2021 non-ses/sl/st salary spending. further, agency budget requests must reflect an increase in awards spending, as a percent of non-ses/sl/st salary spending, from fy 2020 to fy 2021. this increase in awards spending should be no less than 1 percentage point of fy 2021 non-ses/sl/st salary spending. for example, if an agency estimates that awards spending in fy 2020 will equal 1.25 percent of fy 2020 non-ses/sl/st salary spending, that agency must allocate an amount towards awards equal to no less than 2.25 percent of requested non-ses/sl/st salary spending in fy 2021. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 1 of section 32 section 32‚Äîpersonnel compensation, benefits, and related costs consistent with these directions, agency budget requests must clearly denote: (1) the amount allocated for awards spending in fy 2021, and (2) the amount allocated for awards spending in fy 2021 as a percent of requested fy 2021 non-ses/sl/st salary spending. awards spending is defined as the sum of: (1) individual performance awards for non-ses/sl/st employees (nature of action 840) and, (2) individual contribution awards (e.g., special act awards) for nonses/ sl/st employees (nature of action 849). agencies should be prepared to supply additional information on planned and actual expenditures upon request by omb. consistent with forthcoming guidance, this increased level of awards spending will enable agencies to strategically plan incentive awards, bonuses, relocation, recruitment, and retention allowances toward rewarding high-performing employees and those with critical skill sets. (b) hourly rates. for all employees (as defined in 5 u.s.c. 5504(b)), use hourly rates of compensation determined by dividing the annual rate of basic pay by 2,087, in accordance with section 15203(a) of the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 (public law 99‚Äì272). (c) within-grade increases. offset the net cost, if any, of within-grade salary increases (i.e., costs after turnover, downgrades, and other grade or step reducing events are taken into account) by savings due to greater productivity and efficiency. (d) vacancies. for vacancies expected to be filled in the budget year, use the entrance salary for the vacancies involved. (e) savings in personnel compensation. give full consideration to savings in personnel compensation due to personnel reductions, delay in filling vacant positions, leave without pay, lag in recruitment for new positions, filling vacancies at lower rates of pay, part-time employment, and grade reduction actions. identify terminal leave payments, including those for ses, as offsets against such savings. (f) positions above grade gs/gm‚Äì15. reflect these positions, including ses, only to the extent that positions have been authorized in those grades by opm or other authority, or are specifically authorized in substantive law. (g) executive selection and development programs. include in your estimates provisions for reasonable amounts for such programs, as required under title iv of the civil service reform act of 1978 and by implementing guidelines issued by the office of personnel management. (h) premium pay and overtime. fully justify increases over amounts for the preceding year for premium pay. in preparing estimates for overtime, you should analyze the use of overtime to ensure that it is used in a prudent and efficient manner; explore all reasonable alternatives to overtime (such as improved scheduling); and ensure that adequate approval, monitoring, and audit procedures are in place to avoid overtime abuses. (i) special rates for experts and consultants. reflect these positions and rates only to the extent that they are authorized per 5 u.s.c. 3109. (j) severance pay. estimate severance pay at the amount needed for the fiscal year. however, obligations will be incurred on a pay-period by pay-period basis, notwithstanding the fact that a liability arises at the time of an employee\\'s separation. your estimates must include changes in severance pay and personnel compensation that would occur upon any reduction in force. page 2 of section 32 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 32‚Äîpersonnel compensation, benefits, and related costs (k) physicians comparability allowance. reflect in your estimates approved plans to pay physicians comparability allowance under 5 u.s.c. 5948. instructions for reporting on the physicians comparability allowance program are issued separately. (l) bonuses and allowances. reflect in your estimates approved agency plans for paying recruitment and relocation bonuses and retention allowances. you should be prepared to supply information on planned and actual expenditures upon request by omb. (m) retirement costs. reflect in your estimates the cost effects of changes in the distribution of employees between the civil service retirement system (csrs) and the federal employees\\' retirement system (fers). note that fers contributions have changed as described in section 32.3. 32.2 how do i treat agency benefit payments under the federal employees‚Äô compensation act? for accounts subject to appropriations action, include in your budget year estimates the amount billed by the office of workers‚Äô compensation programs of the department of labor for benefits paid on behalf of employees of your agency in the past year under the federal employees‚Äô compensation act. for accounts not subject to appropriations action, you must pay the bill in the current year. 32.3 how do i budget for federal employee retirement costs? agency contributions to the large retirement receipt accounts, including those managed by the departments of defense, state, treasury, the social security administration, and the office of personnel management, should reflect the effects of changes to the agency contribution rates for employee retirement and of civilian and military pay raises using the provisional pay raise assumptions specified for these accounts in section 32.1. contribution rates for csrs employees remain unchanged. agencies may need to adjust estimates when final pay assumptions for the budget are released. this applies to: 1. governmental receipt accounts containing federal employee contributions to federal employee retirement; 2. offsetting receipt accounts (employer share, employee retirement) containing employing agency contributions to federal employee retirement and federal agency share of social security and medicare payroll taxes; and 3. general fund contributions to federal employee retirement. fers contribution rates agency fers contribution rates that became effective beginning fy 2016 can be found in benefits administration letter 15-303 at this link: http://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/publicationsforms/ benefits-administration-letters/2015/15-303.pdf. also, see fy 2020 and fy 2021 contribution rates in the tables below. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 3 of section 32 section 32‚Äîpersonnel compensation, benefits, and related costs fers employees (other than rae and frae) fy 2020 fy 2021 fy 2021 fy 2021 employing employing employee normal cost agency agency contribution contribution contribution regular 16.0% 17.3% 0.8% 18.1% law enforcement 33.4% 35.8% 1.3% 37.1% air traffic controller 33.2% 35.7% 1.3% 37.0% military reserve 18.7% 20.1% 0.8% 20.9% technicians cia special overseas * 23.0% 24.8% 0.8% 25.6% members of 22.2% 23.1% 1.3% 24.4% congress** congressional staff** 23.9% 25.7% 1.3% 27.0% united states postal service and postal regulatory commission postal regular 14.7% 15.7% 0.8% 16.5% postal law 33.4% 35.8% 1.3% 37.1% enforcement fers revised annuity employees (fers-rae) contributions as a percent of pay retirement groups fy 2020 employing agency contribution fy 2021 employing agency contribution fy 2021 employee contribution fy 2021 normal cost regular -rae 14.2% 15.5% 3.1% 18.6% law enforcement rae 31.6% 34.0% 3.6% 37.6% air traffic controller rae 31.4% 33.9% 3.6% 37.5% military reserve 16.8% 18.2% 3.1% 21.3% cia special overseas rae * 21.3% 23.1% 3.1% 26.2% page 4 of section 32 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 32‚Äîpersonnel compensation, benefits, and related costs members of congress rae** 14.2% 15.5% 3.1% 18.6% congressional staff- rae** 16.3% 17.8% 3.1% 20.9% united states postal service and postal regulatory commission postal regular ‚Äì rae 12.8% 13.8% 3.1% 16.9% postal law 31.6% 34.0% 3.6% 37.6% enforcement -rae fers further revised annuity employees (fers-frae) contributions as a percent of pay retirement groups fy 2020 employing agency contribution fy 2021 employing agency contribution fy 2021 employee contribution fy 2021 normal cost regular -frae 14.2% 15.5% 4.4% 18.8% law enforcement frae 31.6% 34.0% 4.9% 37.8% air traffic controller -frae 31.4% 33.9% 4.9% 37.7% military reserve 16.8% 18.2% 4.4% 21.6% cia special overseas -frae * 21.3% 23.1% 4.4% 26.4% members of congress -frae** 14.2% 15.5% 4.4% 18.8% congressional staff frae** 16.3% 17.8% 4.4% 21.1% united states postal service and postal regulatory commission postal regular ‚Äì frae 11.7% 12.7% 4.4% 17.1% postal law enforcement frae 30.5% 32.9% 4.9% 37.8% * employees under section 303 of the cia act of 1964 for certain employees (when serving abroad). ** for information only. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 5 of section 32 section 32‚Äîpersonnel compensation, benefits, and related costs 32.4 how do i budget for unemployment compensation? in general, you should not budget for the costs of unemployment compensation for former federal civilian and military personnel. the congressional intent is that such unemployment compensation be paid from appropriations available to the employing agencies. the liable agencies must absorb these reimbursements when they are required to be paid. if you do not employ large numbers of temporary employees or other personnel expected to lead to significant unemployment compensation claims, your estimates for the current and budget year will not contain any special provisions for the costs of reimbursing the unemployment trust fund for such payments. if you employ large numbers of temporary employees to meet part-year workload, you may request approval from omb to budget for unemployment compensation costs for your temporary employees. omb will consider such requests if you can demonstrate that you have a sound administrative control system for unemployment compensation claims. 32.5 how do i budget for uniformed services health care? ‚Ä¢ for uniformed services post-retirement medical care. post-retirement medical care for \"medicareeligible\" retirees and their dependents/survivors was funded on an accrual basis beginning in fy 2003. budget estimates must assume inclusion of all medicare-eligible retirees and families. agencies must calculate the following estimates for their budget submission: ‚Ä¢ accrual contribution to the department of defense medicare-eligible retiree health care fund. ‚Ä¢ estimate of the health care dollars to be expended for all retirees. ‚Ä¢ accrual contribution to the department of defense medicare-eligible retiree health care fund. to develop appropriate annual accrual contribution estimates, agencies must use the per-capita rates set by the department of defense medicare-eligible retiree health care board of actuaries. every summer, the board sends a letter to the agencies promulgating the annual per-capita rates. agencies must multiply these rates by the estimated average number of current uniformed service personnel. the resulting calculation is the accrual contribution, which should be budgeted in the agency‚Äôs personnel account. ‚Ä¢ estimate of the health care dollars to be expended for all retirees. agencies must estimate expenditures for retiree health care. (separate estimates must be provided for medicare-eligible retirees and non-medicare-eligible retirees). the medicare-eligible estimates are needed to develop the trust fund outlays for uniformed service health care and the non-medicare eligible estimates to be included in agency budgets. to prevent double counting medicare-eligibles, each agency must ensure that their health care account request does not include any amount for medicare-eligible retiree health care other than the accrual contribution amounts. 32.6 are there other places in a‚Äì11 where i can find related guidance? yes.

accounts or sub-accounts. in addition, you should include the full cost of a program where possible. in some cases, you may want to consider requesting budgetary resources to cover all indirect costs in the budget account or program activity that funds the program, and paying for all central services as they are used. in other cases, you may want to request appropriations for some central accounts providing support services; in these cases, you should include a table showing the full cost of resources used by each program, whether paid from its budget account or not. present resources required for py and cy, as well as the estimated requirements for each funding option for by through by+9, where applicable. if cy cancellations or supplementals are pending or proposed, identify these separately. a subsidiary breakdown of such items as personnel compensation, capital outlay, or other categories of special concern would be useful. generally, present financial data in terms of budgetary resources by year. however, your omb representative may require additional measures, such as unobligated balances and offsetting collections. describe budgetary resources requests in the context of your management plan for the programs and activities. describe resources requested for it investments in the context of your program requirements. for it expenditures proposed, demonstrate that all opportunities for coordination with administration goals and eliminating redundant activities have been explored. explain the analysis used to determine the resources needed to accomplish program and administration goals, and demonstrate that all opportunities for making more efficient and effective use of resources have been explored. 51.4 relationship of justification to account structure to the extent possible, you should attempt to align your budget accounts with programs, distinguishing among components that contribute to different strategic objectives. where the major

expenditures. report programs that are mainly grants, contracts or other transfers of funds to entities other than your agency, related salaries and expense accounts and parts of accounts, including allocations of overhead amounts. where it is helpful to explain the coverage of the table or the relationship among accounts, prepare a short narrative to accompany the table. this requirement only applies to major programs and activities. you should consult your omb representative to ensure that you provide tables for appropriate activities and that you avoid unnecessary paperwork. 51.5 agency restructuring or work process redesign you should identify restructuring or process reengineering activities resulting from proposed and current investments in it and other areas that yield budgetary savings. indicate how these activities allow your agency to utilize existing resources better while improving program management and service delivery. page 6 of section 51 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 51‚Äîbasic justification materials 51.6 information on grant programs and infrastructure investment include copies of systematic economic analyses of expected benefits and costs completed in accordance with executive order 12893. 51.7 performance goals, measures, and indicators agency budget submissions for the fy 2021 budget may be structured as the performance plan required by the gpra modernization act of 2010 (see also 31 u.s.c. 1115). therefore, you need not submit a separate performance plan to comply with the act. your budget submission should cover all of your agency\\'s programs and should address all statutory requirements of the \"annual performance plan\" required by the gpra modernization act of 2010. sections 240 and 210 contain detailed information on performance plan requirements. additional details on applicable public posting and notification requirements are also included in section 22. 51.8 other analytical information additional information may be required in budget justifications on the following: ‚Ä¢ workload analyses; ‚Ä¢ unit costs; ‚Ä¢ productivity trends; ‚Ä¢ enterprise risk management profiles; and ‚Ä¢ impact of capital investment proposals on productivity. use productivity measurement, unit costs, enterprise risk management, and organizational performance standards to the maximum extent possible in justifying staffing and other requirements. include as a specific element in productivity improvement for activities of federal staff the gains planned or being realized from streamlining, including reduction of unnecessary overhead, creative use of technology, and elimination of low priority tasks and programs. you should also be prepared to provide information on the basis for distributing funds (e.g., formulas or principles for allocation, matching, policies regarding the awarding of loans, grants, or contracts, etc.) and data on resulting geographic distribution (e.g., by state, etc.), with identification of any issues. 51.9 evidence and evaluation agencies should strengthen the use of data and evidence (defined in section 200.22) to drive better decision-making and achieve greater impact and efficiencies. to further these efforts, agencies are required to submit an evidence template as part of their fy 2021 budget submissions. this template is designed to provide omb

have a high level of assurance that the funds dedicated to capital acquisitions support the agency mission and provide value to the taxpayer. in addition, agencies should be able to justify page 10 of section 51 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 51‚Äîbasic justification materials the acquisition and operation of an asset. the generation of a sound business case is a best practice for providing that justification and assurance. a business case should include the rationale for the investment and reference any supporting analysis. the capital programming guide provides guidance on the principles and techniques for effective capital programming. additionally, budget terms and definitions are included in appendix j, \"principles of budgeting for capital asset acquisitions.\" other references related to capital assets are included in appendix k, \"selected omb guidance and other references regarding capital assets.\" the policy, budget justification, and reporting requirements for capital assets apply to all agencies of the executive branch of the government subject to executive branch review. agency business cases are due at the same time as your agency\\'s annual budget submission (see table 1 in section 25). (b) information technology (it) required data for all it investments is provided by agencies reporting through the it dashboard addressing both overall it investment spending (the agency\\'s it portfolio), and the information required for major it investments, as described at: https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/egov/ agencies not reporting data to the it dashboard are also accountable for adhering to the guidance provided to all agencies on how to conduct it capital planning internally, as addressed in the above guidance, and also in circular a-130, and the capital programming guide. budget process guidance is communicated to such agencies individually, regarding the data to be submitted as part of their agency budget submissions in the fall, based on the requirements of omb rmo with agency oversight responsibility, and other considerations. (c) non-information technology (non-it) in general, business cases are required for the acquisition and operation of non-it capital assets. the definition of capital asset can be found in appendix 1 of the capital programming guide. links to the template and instructions for the business case are provided in section 25, table 1. the instructions include submission requirements, deadlines, and exemptions.

ex‚Äì54 space budget justification 54.1 do i need to report on rental payments? if your agency obligates more than $5 million annually for rental payments to the general services administration (gsa) or to others (e.g., other federal agencies or commercial landlords) for rental of space, structures and facilities, and land and building services, you must submit a space budget justification in the format of exhibit 54 at the same time as your agency\\'s annual budget submission (see section 54.2 for the e-mail address for the submission, which must be coordinated with all relevant agency officials). omb uses this information to evaluate your budget request for rent in the context of personnel and program changes (e.g., downsizing). gsa uses this information to refine its estimates of rental costs. you should use this information to analyze your space requirements and rental costs. for reporting purposes, include amounts for the services covered by the basic rental charge assessed by gsa as obligations for rental payments to gsa, but exclude amounts above standard services, such as overtime utility services. from gsa\\'s monthly bill, use line d, \"total annual rental\" plus, in some cases, line 14a \"billing adjustments and corrections, current year\" to compare to the amount on the line \"gsa rent estimate\" of exhibit 54. these amounts are already net of obligations for the cost of operations in buildings where gsa has delegated authority for building operations. the cost of building operations in buildings whose operational authority is delegated should be budgeted in the appropriate object classes, such as 25.4, operations and maintenance of facilities. these costs should appear on exhibit 54. make your obligations for rental payments to gsa (part 1 of exhibit 54) and your obligations for other space services paid to non-gsa entities (part 2) consistent with data reported as rental payments under the appropriate object classes (see section 54.4). 54.2 what materials must i provide? you must submit an overall summary report in the format of exhibit 54 for the agency as a whole. this report provides a justification of your agency\\'s budget request for rent. in addition, you must submit a separate report for each bureau or subordinate organization that makes rental payments. submit a single agency-wide summary report if these costs are paid for centrally from one account. you must complete exhibit 54 using an electronic excel spreadsheet available from gsa. the spreadsheet format includes inflation factors to calculate outyear estimates automatically and it generates total obligations for rental costs and funding sources. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 1 of section 54 section 54‚Äîrental payments for space and land the report contains information for py through by+1 on: ‚Ä¢ rental payments to gsa, which reconciles the gsa rent estimate with actual, planned, and requested changes in inventory. ‚Ä¢ funding sources for these rental payments to gsa. ‚Ä¢ rental payments to others, both non-federal and federal sources. ‚Ä¢ supporting detail on all changes from the gsa rent bill or gsa estimates of rental costs (see section 54.5). your submission must support your budget year request and list all applicable appropriations and/or other funding sources by account. report space requirements to the nearest square foot; state obligations in thousands of dollars and round to the nearest thousand. where an amount falls exactly halfway in between, round to the nearest even figure (for example, both $11,500 and $12,500 round to $12). do not identify amounts of $500 or less. in addition to the materials provided with your budget submission, submit electronic versions of these materials both to gsa and omb by sending e-mails to the following addresses: ombexhibit54@gsa.gov and exhibit54@omb.eop.gov exhibit 54 is due with the budget submission. before sending the completed spreadsheet, verify that the subject line has the three-digit cgac agency code (see appendix c) and the full agency name. 54.3 what terms do i need to know? agency means departments and establishments of the government, and bureau means the principal subordinate organizational units of an agency. gsa bureau code means the agency/bureau code(s) recorded on the gsa rent bills or gsa budget estimates for each bureau making rental payments. (this number is not the same as the 2‚Äìdigit omb bureau code described in section 79.2 and appendix c.) gsa rent estimate means a document developed by gsa and sent to customer agencies once a year. this document provides budget year data on estimated assigned space and the associated costs of that space. it is used by gsa\\'s customers for planning and budgeting purposes. you should use this year\\'s gsa budget estimate (available this summer) to report the gsa rent estimate for the cy and by. omb-approved inflation factor means the inflation factor used in the gsa budget estimate. mid- session review inflation factors will be used for cy through by+1. the electronic spreadsheet format provided to you will use these factors to automatically inflate certain outyear estimates. chargeback (or adjustments to the bill) means the process by which gsa\\'s customers contest a gsa billing. if you claim a chargeback, you are required to complete a standard form 2972 if you are an ipac agency and a form 2992 if you are a non-ipac agency and provide supporting chargeback data justifying your claim. total workplace fit (furniture, information technology) program budget request will be included on the exhibit 54, if you intend to classify those charges as object class 23.1, rental payments to gsa. page 2 of section 54 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 54‚Äîrental payments for space and land the fit estimate should be entered on the sum worksheet in row 33 for the by \"budget year\" (column n) and by+1 (column q). more information can be found on the gsa web site http://www.gsa.gov/exhibit 54 by downloading the pdf file \"total workplace fit (furniture and it) booklet‚Äìgsa\". 54.4 how do i prepare the space budget justification? the following table explains the information needed to prepare the space budget justification (see exhibit 54). exhibit 54 illustrates the summary page of the submission. there are five worksheets that contain the detail for the chargebacks, planned changes to inventory and the requested program changes. one worksheet is for the chargebacks, and there is one for each year in which to detail planned changes to inventory and the requested program changes (i.e., py, cy, by and by+1). the summary justification consists of two parts: ‚Ä¢ rental payments to gsa (part 1). (with the exception of the lines \"other adjustments,\" \"statutorily-imposed rent caps,\" and \"funding sources for rental payments to gsa,\" data in this part is derived by formula from five back-up worksheets); and ‚Ä¢ rental payments to others (part 2). subtotals, totals, and certain other entries indicated in boldface will be automatically calculated (see exhibit 54). information required for the space budget justification entry description report in dollars and to the nearest square foot on the individual worksheets. the totals will be automatically calculated for the summary page, with obligations rounded to the nearest thousand. report net estimates of rental costs and square feet (i.e., net of any adjustments within the relevant category being reported). part 1-a: rental in part

omb agency/bureau code followed by the 4‚Äìdigit basic account symbol assigned by treasury (xxx‚Äìxx‚Äìxxxx) (see section 79.2). for py‚Äìby+1, include the amount of obligations for rental payments to gsa that are funded from annual appropriations and permanent appropriations to general, special, and trust funds. if there are more than three accounts listed, change the electronic spreadsheet to add rows, as needed. subtotal, direct appropriations report the sum of amounts of direct appropriations for a year for accounts listed. if more than three accounts are listed, change the spreadsheet formula to calculate the amount funded by direct appropriations. funded by other sources: list all other sources of funding for rental payments to gsa (i.e., other than direct appropriations) by account title and id code (described above). account title and id code include additional information on the line stub to identify the source of funding, as necessary. for py‚Äìby+1, include the amount of obligations for rental payments to gsa that are funded from reimbursements, other offsetting collections, and allocations. if there are more than three accounts listed, change the electronic spreadsheet to add rows, as needed. subtotal, other funding sources total, net rental payments to gsa (object class 23.1) report the sum of amounts for other funding sources for a year for accounts listed. if more than three accounts are listed, change the spreadsheet formula to calculate the amount funded by other sources. report the sum of amounts paid to gsa for all funding sources (direct appropriations plus other funding sources) for a year for accounts listed. report amounts that are consistent with obligations classified as \"rental payments to gsa\" (object class 23.1). make the

include obligations for payments to federal agencies other than gsa for space, land, and structures that are subleased or occupied by permits, regardless of whether the space is owned or leased. note: typically, with the approval of the administrator of gsa, you may sublease your gsa-assigned space to another agency or bureau. in such page 4 of section 54 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 54‚Äîrental payments for space and land entry description cases, if you are the agency assigned the space by gsa, report rental payments for this space in part 1 as \"rental payments to gsa.\" if you are the agency or bureau subleasing space from another agency or bureau, report payments for the sublease in part 2 as \"federal sources other than gsa.\" report amounts consistent with obligations for rental payments to federal sources reported as \"purchases of goods and services from government accounts\" (object class 25.3). total, rental payments to others report the sum of amounts as rental payments to non-federal sources and to federal sources other than gsa. make the totals consistent with rental obligations classified in object classes 23.2 and 25.3. 54.5 what supporting

technology investments this administration is maintaining a continued focus on strengthening it portfolio management and remains firmly committed to assessing the effectiveness of current it management practices in order to address opportunities to improve management of it resources. it and business leaders must have access to authoritative data in order to effectuate data-driven discussions about cost and value of it to best support business goals. provide more granular data for it spending. to gain increased granularity about it spending across the federal it portfolio, agencies will be asked to provide the following data for each investment: ‚Ä¢ development, modernization, and enhancement (dme) and operations and maintenance (o&m); ‚Ä¢ it cost pools; and ‚Ä¢ it towers. the fy 2021 cycle will complete the phased implementation of more granular it cost reporting. while there is no expectation that agencies will change authoritative data systems at this time, agencies should continue to categorize costs into it cost pools and it towers. over time, omb will work with agencies to determine how to automate authoritative data collection. completed implementation of standard investment types to promote government-wide consistency. through the fy 2020 cycle, the platform, output, application, and delivery standard investments were optional. these four standard investment categories are now required for the fy 2021 reporting cycle. this will enable government-wide comparisons and improve benchmarking metrics. ‚Ä¢ some standard investments will have corresponding reports, relevant to their investment type. ‚Ä¢ all standard investments will enable agency cios to compare like costs, capabilities and functions across organizational components and support fitara implementation. 55.2 why must i report on information technology investments? as part of the budget process, omb is required to develop and oversee a process for it budgeting and portfolio management, with a detailed focus on all major capital investments, to include \"analyzing, tracking, and evaluating the risks, including information security risks, and results of all major capital investments made by an executive agency for information systems.\" 40 u.s.c. 11302. omb also is responsible for it portfolio oversight (44 u.s.c. 3602), i.e. the use of information technologies to enhance access of information and delivery of services; and to increase the effectiveness, efficiency, service quality, or transformation of government operations. agencies must provide required data on total it funding using the formats specified in the fy 2021 it budget ‚Äì capital planning guidance. it funding information should be consistent with the overall agency budget submission (see section 51.19), and your agency\\'s enterprise architecture (ea), agency it portfolio summary components, and agency it portfolio detail components. it investment costs must include funding from all federal budgetary resources (e.g., direct appropriation, collections, transfers, and unobligated balances) and must: ‚Ä¢ ensure security of federal information systems and data and account for a modernization process to secure information systems by design; ‚Ä¢ account for regular software and product lifecycle refreshment; and page 2 of section 55 omb circular no. a-11 (2019) section 55‚Äîinformation technology investments ‚Ä¢ leverage best practices from other organizations to increase agility and flexibility in technology programs. 55.3 what specific guidance applies to fy 2021, and when is the information required? submissions should be consistent with omb fiscal year 2021 budget guidance. timing details for it budget submission requirements are outlined in the fy 2021 it budget ‚Äì capital planning guidance. additional updates to the agency it portfolio summary, major it business cases, and standard investment reports may be applicable after final budget release in order to reflect changes in funding levels due to enactment of appropriations. specific instructions and deadlines for submitting updates, corrections, and final submissions of exhibits will be available on the omb max federal community. chief information officers (cios), senior agency officials for privacy (saops), chief financial officers (cfos), and budget officers must coordinate to ensure that it budget data is consistent with the agency\\'s budget submission, and must complete \"it resources statements\" described in section 51.3. the annual e-gov max collection of

‚Ä¢ each agency managing or contributing to e-government and line-of-business initiatives must report as a distinct investment within their it portfolio summary. 55.4 how should agencies align it investments with their strategic plans? an agency\\'s it investment management and reporting of it investments must clearly demonstrate that each investment is needed to help meet the agency\\'s strategic goals and mission and show how governance processes are used to plan, select, develop, implement, and operate those it investments. furthermore, each it investment should demonstrate the enabling and improvement of mission and program performance by providing meaningful data. agencies demonstrate the it investment requirements and governance processes through agency major it business cases, supporting documentation, information resources management strategic plan, enterprise roadmap, and agency it portfolio summary submissions. the agency must further demonstrate how the investment supports a business line or enterprise service performance goal as documented in the agency\\'s enterprise architecture (ea), and annual enterprise roadmap submission to omb. in particular, investments should indicate when they include spending on geospatial-related costs through alignment with federal enterprise architecture (fea) business reference model (brm) code. documents used to manage the planning, development, implementation, and operation of it investments and documents that demonstrate the outcomes of agency, branch, and bureau governance decisions should be maintained and made readily available if requested by omb. agency strategic planning should incorporate the requirement for regular software and product lifecycle refresh. the individual agency\\'s agency it portfolio summary submissions are used to create an overall \"federal it portfolio,\" which is published as part of the president\\'s budget. agency and omb portfolio reviews and budget processes will ensure the selection of it investments that support the agency\\'s strategic objectives or performance goals, as captured in the agency\\'s strategic plan and annual performance plan. agencies are

omb provides specific policy, procedural, and analytic guidelines for planning, budgeting, acquisition, and management of major it capital investments, which is defined within the fy 2021 it budget ‚Äì capital planning guidance appendix c, in addition to general guidance issued in omb circular a-11 and omb circular a-130. an agency\\'s major it business cases describe the justification, planning, implementation, and operations of individual capital assets included in the agency it portfolio summary and serve as key artifacts of the agency\\'s ea and it capital planning processes. the major it business case is comprised of two components: 1) the major business case itself, which provides key high-level investment information to inform budget decisions, including general information and planning for resources such as staffing and personnel. 2) the regular information updates to the major it business case, which provides more temporal information, related to tracking management of an investment, such as projects and activities, risks, and operational performance of the investment. this includes the cio\\'s responsibility to assess each major it investment pursuant to 40 u.s.c. 11315(c)(2). 55.8 what do i need to know about standard it investment reports? standard it infrastructure investments were introduced in fy 2018\\'s guidance. this year\\'s guidance completes the phased implementation of standard investment reports with relevant reporting requirements for each standard it infrastructure and management investment. agencies shall complete their realignment of costs represented in their it portfolio summary part 3: it infrastructure, it security and it management non-standard investments into standard investments that will be consistent throughout and across each agency. the updated reporting requirements are intended to provide more visibility to agency cios. the standard investments are related to costs associated with all agencies. each standard investment will have its own reporting requirements and frequency. complete details on specifications for completing agency it portfolio summary and major it business cases are provided in the fy 2021 it budget ‚Äì capital planning guidance. omb circular no. a-11 (2019) page 7 of section 55 section 79‚Äîthe budget data system section 79‚Äîthe budget data system table of contents 79.1 what is the max system and how do i report data in max? 79.2 what should i know about account identification codes? 79.3 which transmittal code should i use? 79.4 how do i request new accounts, changes to existing accounts in max? 79.5 what are the max schedules?

ex‚Äì79d examples of different account identification codes 79.1 what is the max system and how do i report data in max? max a-11 data entry (max) is a computer system used to collect and process most of the information required for preparing the budget. max compiles the budget data using a series of schedules, or sets of data, within the max database. each schedule describes a view of the president\\'s budget. an overview of all the schedules is provided in section 79.5. to submit the data to populate the budget schedules, appropriations language, and narrative text, use this web address to access max: https://a11de.max.gov consult the max a‚Äì11 home community page for resources about how to use max. you report data at the budget account level in max (see section 20.11(a)). this information is aggregated to provide the totals presented in many of the tables in the president\\'s budget. most amounts are reported in millions of dollars. the preferred method of rounding numbers is to the nearest even million (for example, both $11,500,000 and $12,500,000 would round to 12); however, use of standard off-the-shelf packages that round up when a number is exactly mid-way between two whole numbers is acceptable (for example, $11,500,000 would round to 12 and $12,500,000 would round to 13). you must use max to submit your budget data. if data has already been entered for a particular account and transmittal code, you can retrieve and change the data using max. for a new account or transmittal code, you must create new shells of schedules before you can enter data. the community page provides instructions on how to insert and edit schedules. you can also use max to generate several diagnostic reports. max contains information on budget account titles and classifications and controls data entry. before you can submit your budget data, an account must be present in omb‚Äôs database. section 79.4 provides information on how to request new accounts or request changes to existing accounts. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 1 of section 79 section 79‚Äîthe budget data system max contains numerous crosschecks or error messages (\"edit checks\") to help ensure the consistency of the data. you can see all of the error messages in the max edit checks report on the budget season reports page. 79.2 what should i know about account identification codes? omb, in consultation with the department of the treasury, assigns account identification codes. these codes are used to store and access data in max, run reports, and identify accounts in omb and treasury documents and max reports. while you can access your accounts in max without knowing the account number, you are required to perform several steps that can be eliminated if you do know it. each account can be identified in several ways. for example, you can access your accounts in max by entering either the omb account number or the treasury account number. regardless of which number you use, familiarity with the following coding options is helpful. see exhibit 79d for examples of various account code combinations, and appendix c for a list of omb agency and bureau codes, and treasury and cgac agency codes. ‚Ä¢ omb agency code‚Äîeach department or independent agency has a unique three-digit number assigned by omb. ‚Ä¢ omb bureau code‚Äîeach bureau within each department or major agency has an agency-unique two-digit number assigned by omb. agencies that do not have distinct bureaus have a bureau code of \"00\". most receipt accounts do not have a distinct bureau and have a bureau code of \"00\". ‚Ä¢ treasury agency code‚Äîeach agency also has a two-digit number assigned by treasury. the use of these two-digit codes is being phased out. ‚Ä¢ common government-wide accounting classification (cgac) agency code‚Äîeach department or independent agency has a unique three-digit agency identifier assigned by treasury. agencies and omb are in the process of transitioning from the two-digit treasury agency code to the three-digit cgac agency code. in most cases, the cgac agency code for departments and major independent agencies is equal to zero followed by the old two-digit treasury agency code. for other independent agencies, it is usually equal to the omb agency code. ‚Ä¢ account symbol‚Äîeach account has a four-digit main account code assigned by treasury (or, in the case of merged accounts, by omb) that corresponds to the fund type (e.g., general, special). for receipt accounts, omb combines this account symbol with the sub-account code to create an agency-unique six-digit symbol for display. ‚Ä¢ transmittal code‚Äîeach account in max has a one-digit code that identifies the nature or timing of the associated schedules as described in section 79.3. ‚Ä¢ fund code‚Äîsection 20.11 explains fund codes and the account symbols associated with each fund type. ‚Ä¢ subfunction code‚Äîomb assigns each account a three-digit code that corresponds to the account\\'s subfunctional classification (e.g., national defense, income security, agriculture). (see section 79.4(d) for further explanation of subfunctions and exhibit 79a for a list of functional classifications.) page 2 of section 79 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 79‚Äîthe budget data system 79.3 which transmittal code should i use? the following codes are used to identify the nature or timing of the request. most requests that are transmitted to the congress in the president\\'s budget are for appropriations for the upcoming fiscal year. these requests are normally reported under transmittal code 0. transmittal code title and description 0 regular budget schedules. 1 supplemental proposal. use only for requesting supplemental cy amounts. 2 legislative proposal, not subject to paygo. use for the effects of proposals requiring authorizing legislation where those effects are not subject to paygo. these include both discretionary proposals that are contingent on the enactment of authorizing legislation, as well as mandatory and revenue proposals that do not have a paygo impact, e.g., new interfund payments. do not use for routine reauthorization of ongoing programs. 3 appropriations language to be transmitted later. use only with prior approval of omb when language for a significant policy proposal cannot be transmitted in the budget. 4 legislative proposal, subject to paygo. use for the effects of proposals requiring authorizing legislation that are subject to paygo. do not use for routine reauthorization of ongoing discretionary programs or for an extension of a mandatory program assumed to be continued in the baseline (transmit 0). 5 rescission proposal pursuant to title 10 of the congressional budget and impoundment control act. use only for requesting rescission of cy amounts. 7 reserved for omb use. 8 overseas contingency operations. use only for amounts requested for by through by+9. 9 reserved for omb use. separate schedules using non-zero transmittal codes are required to identify proposed authorizing legislation, supplementals requested in the budget, and items proposed for later transmittal under either existing or proposed authorizing legislation or their effect on the information presented in the regular schedule for the account. the combination of the regular schedule and the non-zero transmittal code schedule should display the condition of the account as it would exist if the congress enacts the proposals. when a supplemental proposal or legislative proposal involves a transfer between accounts, omit the transaction from the regular (transmittal code 0) schedules and display it in separate schedules for each of the affected accounts. see exhibit 79c for help in determining if your legislative proposal should be coded as a transmittal code 0, 2, or 4. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 3 of section 79 section 79‚Äîthe budget data system 79.4 how do i request new accounts, changes to existing accounts in max? the max database contains information on budget account titles and classifications and controls data entry. among other things, it contains information on: ‚Ä¢ the account title, as it will be printed in the budget; ‚Ä¢ the treasury and omb identification codes; ‚Ä¢ fund type; ‚Ä¢ subfunctional classification; ‚Ä¢ budget enforcement (bea) category; ‚Ä¢ congressional subcommittee assignment; ‚Ä¢ type of account (e.g., expenditure, receipt, trust, special, revolving); ‚Ä¢ whether more than half of the collections are user charges; ‚Ä¢ whether the account will finance payments for individuals; ‚Ä¢ whether the account has obligation limitations; ‚Ä¢ citation of legal authority to establish the account; ‚Ä¢ for receipt accounts, the receipt type and source category; and for offsetting receipts, character classification (see section 84.3(d)); and ‚Ä¢ where the account will be printed in the budget (see section 95.3). (a) general if you need to request a new account or make changes to an existing account, please contact your omb budget representative. if requesting a new account, you will need to provide information on all the items in the bulleted list above except for the identification codes. these classifications are discussed further below. for new deposit funds, only a subset of the information above is required, as deposit funds are not included in omb‚Äôs max database. provide the citation of legal authority and any proposed account number and title. omb collaborates with treasury‚Äôs bureau of the fiscal service to assign treasury account symbols (tas) and titles. fiscal service establishes new treasury appropriation fund symbols (tafs)‚Äîwhich include the expenditure account period of availability along with the account symbol‚Äîderived from the annual appropriation bills without an agency request. for new account actions pursuant to other legislation, agencies must send a letter of request to fiscal service. for more information about the letter of request, see the treasury financial manual (tfm). when you request a new account, omb will coordinate with treasury, as required; make the necessary changes; and notify you when the change is complete. if you want to propose new financing methods, reorganizations, account mergers, or changes to the program activity structure in the program and financing schedule, omb approval is required. you should submit requests for such changes by october 1, unless omb specifies another date. if a change is dependent on pending decisions or results from late congressional action or other circumstances beyond your control, submit the request as soon as possible after october 1. if prospective internal reorganizations are likely to require budget structure changes, obtain omb approval prior to implementing the reorganization. until requests are approved, base budget materials on the existing structure. if changes are approved, you must revise budget schedules and other materials accordingly. page 4 of section 79 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 79‚Äîthe budget data system (b) fund type and code omb and treasury will assign identification codes based on the type of fund involved and other characteristics of the proposed new account. the account symbol is based on the fund type. see section 20.11 for a detailed discussion of fund types. fund types and codes omb treasury account symbol type of fund fund fund code code 0000‚Äì3899 general fund 1 eg 3800-3899 any receipt accounts here are clearing accounts 5000‚Äì5999 special fund 2 es 4000‚Äì4499 public enterprise revolving fund 3 ep 4500‚Äì4999 intragovernmental revolving fund 4 er 3900‚Äì3999 management fund 4 3900-3959 consolidated working fund ec 3960-3999 management fund em 8000‚Äì8399 and 8500‚Äì8999 trust non-revolving fund 7 et 8400‚Äì8499 trust revolving fund 8 tr 6000‚Äì6999 deposit fund n/a 90xx assigned by omb to designate allowances 991x‚Äì998x assigned by omb for certain merged accounts (c) bea category for each expenditure or receipt account, omb assigns a bea category (e.g., discretionary, mandatory) that designates how the budgetary resources of the account will be classified for budget enforcement purposes (see section 81.2 for a summary of budget enforcement data classifications). in cases where the account will contain resources classified in more than one bea category, omb will identify the account as a \"split\" account. (d) functional and subfunctional classification omb normally assigns each expenditure and offsetting receipt account a single subfunction code (see exhibit 79a for a list of functional classifications). in rare cases, an appropriation account may be split between two or more subfunctions. if the subfunctions are in the same function, the code of the function is used (e.g., 500, 550, etc.). if two or more functions are involved, the code \"999\" is used. annually, omb consults with cbo and other relevant budget and appropriation committee staff members regarding functional and subfunctional classification. this process, which is required by statute, typically occurs from october through december (see section 25.3). omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 5 of section 79 section 79‚Äîthe budget data system (e) user charge classification omb designates whether any collections related to the account are user charges, as defined in section 20.7(g). governmental receipts, offsetting receipts, and offsetting collections may be classified as user charges. (f) receipt type receipt accounts are classified either as governmental receipts or offsetting receipts. if the receipts associated with a particular program have more than one classification, separate receipt accounts must be established (see section 20.7 for a full discussion of receipts). (g) source category code each receipt type has a number of unique source category codes that enable max to produce tables needed for the budget. omb assigns the codes when a new receipt account is established by determining the receipt type for the account and selecting an appropriate program category within that receipt type (see exhibit 79b for a list of source category codes). (h) payments for individuals an account finances payments for individuals if it pays for federal government spending programs designed to transfer income (in cash or in kind) to individuals or families. to the extent feasible, this category does not include reimbursements for current services rendered to the government (e.g., salaries and interest). the payments may be in the form of cash paid directly to individuals or they may take the form of the provision of services or the payment of bills for activities generally financed from personal income. (i) account mergers two or more treasury accounts may be merged into a single budget account with a single set of budget schedules: ‚Ä¢ when two or more appropriation accounts are replaced by a single appropriation. sometimes the amounts in the old accounts are merged by law into the successor account. ‚Ä¢ when the budget proposes to merge several appropriations into a single account and request budget year appropriations on that basis. the objective of such proposed mergers is to permit greater flexibility in achieving program goals by managing and budgeting at a higher level of aggregation. this objective must be balanced against other needs, including the need for public disclosure and review and control by the president and the congress. ‚Ä¢ for revolving fund feeder accounts, which are appropriation accounts whose budgetary resources are available only for transfer to specified revolving fund accounts. they should be merged into the revolving funds to which they relate, and the amounts included in the feeder accounts should not be separately identified. ‚Ä¢ in some situations, omb may choose to merge two or more treasury accounts for presentation purposes. in the case of mergers involving trust funds and federal funds, a trust fund may be merged into a federal fund presentation (and vice versa) only if the amounts in the trust fund (or in the federal fund) are too small to round to at least a million dollars. page 6 of section 79 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 79‚Äîthe budget data system the data is displayed in the appendix in a single budget account, but the underlying tafss continue to be accounted for separately pursuant to law, unless congressional action merges them. 79.5 what are the max schedules? the following table lists the max schedules:

80.2 what general rules do i need to know? 80.3 what rules apply to discretionary spending and collections? 80.4 what rules apply to mandatory spending and collections? 80.5 what rules apply to mandatory supplemental requests? 80.6 what rules apply to governmental receipts? 80.7 what materials must i provide in support of baseline estimates? 80.1 what are the basic requirements? omb baseline estimates follow the rules in section 257 of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985, as amended (bbedca). the baseline rules were reinstated through amendments to bbedca enacted in the budget control act of 2011 (bca). each agency, including the legislative and judicial branches, must submit estimates of budgetary resources, outlays, and receipts that project the cy levels into by through by+9, except: ‚Ä¢ for credit financing accounts, baseline data is required only for net financing disbursements; and ‚Ä¢ government-sponsored enterprises do not have to submit baseline estimates. section 82 provides detailed information on entering baseline data into max. bbedca provides explicit instructions on how to develop the baseline estimates. some apply to all baseline estimates. however, most rules are specific to two categories of collections and spending: ‚Ä¢ those that are controlled through annual appropriations acts (discretionary spending); and ‚Ä¢ those that are controlled through authorizing legislation (mandatory spending and receipts). the classification of collections and spending as discretionary or mandatory spending generally follows the criteria specified in bbedca. consult your omb representative if you have questions concerning the classification. omb may work with affected agencies to make adjustments to the estimates to produce an adjusted baseline to be used in the budget documents. 80.2 what general rules do i need to know? the baseline is a projection of the budgetary resources, outlays, and receipts for mandatory programs and governmental receipts based generally on current law, and a projection of the current year (cy) levels of budgetary resources, outlays, and receipts into the outyears for discretionary programs. below are general rules that apply to the baseline estimates: ‚Ä¢ legislative proposals. legislative proposals are considered to be changes from the baseline projection. do not reflect their budgetary effects in the baseline estimates. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 1 of section 80 section 80‚Äîdevelopment of baseline estimates ‚Ä¢ supplementals. include only supplementals associated with mandatory programs that would finance obligations required by current law in the baseline. ‚Ä¢ regulations, management initiatives, and administrative actions. include the effects of these actions, including planned regulations that are not final, in the baseline estimates, as long as they can be implemented without further legislation. ‚Ä¢ credit programs. base the estimates for credit programs on enacted appropriations of subsidy budget authority for direct loans and guaranteed loan commitments. in addition, see section 185.11(d) for baseline requirements for net financing disbursements in liquidating and financing accounts (schedule y). 80.3 what rules apply to discretionary spending and collections? follow the bbedca guidelines and base the baseline estimates for discretionary spending and collections on the levels provided in the most recent appropriations act or full-year continuing resolution (cr). if a part-year cr is in effect, base the estimates on the annualized level of the cr. except for advance appropriations, the most recent appropriations act or full-year cr is normally for the current year. (a) current year base estimates will equal the enacted current year amounts reported in max under transmittal code 0. you must separate discretionary budgetary resources, except those related to spending authority from offsetting collections, into portions related to civilian pay and benefits, military pay and benefits, or not related to pay and benefits. see section 81.2 for pay and non-pay definitions. (b) by through by+9 baseline estimates in most cases, baseline estimates of budgetary resources are calculated by max to be equal to the most recent full year appropriation (generally the cy level) adjusted for anticipated pay and non-pay inflation using factors supplied by omb. for the four bbedca-specified accounts with social insurance administrative expenses (the federal hospital insurance trust fund, the supplementary medical insurance trust fund, the unemployment trust fund, and the rail industry pension fund), you must report estimates of the beneficiary population (see explanation of line 5150-00 in section 82.9). for programs financed by the highway and mass transit trust fund and controlled by annual obligation limitations, projections of discretionary outlays are derived from a projection with inflation of the cy level of the obligation limitation. outlays from budgetary resources provided prior to the budget year should be the same in the baseline and in the presidential policy estimates. baseline budgetary resources in the cy and beyond generally should outlay at a rate that is consistent with presidential policy spendout rates. section 82.6 describes outlays more fully. (c) advance appropriations if an account is completely funded through advance appropriations, the last year of the enacted advance appropriation is the base for calculating the baseline estimate for the remaining years. however, if the congress discontinues an advance appropriation and provides the funding for that advance in the current page 2 of section 80 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 80‚Äîdevelopment of baseline estimates appropriations instead, the last year of the advance appropriation should be assumed to be zero, and the regular appropriation should be inflated accordingly. if an account is funded with both current and advance appropriations, inflate the current appropriation as described in (b) above; for the advance appropriation, follow the guidance in the paragraph above. (d) discretionary credit accounts max inflates cy subsidy budget authority using the annual adjustment factor for non-pay costs from the economic assumptions for the budget. the estimated policy subsidy rate for the by should be a separate and distinct calculation from that done for the cy. the omb credit subsidy calculator computes the subsidy rate using the economic assumptions for the budget. (see section 185.5 for instructions on calculating baseline subsidy estimates, including programs with negative subsidies.) omb does not collect baseline information on direct loan obligations and guarantee commitments. (e) discretionary offsetting collections and receipts the baseline estimates should be consistent with the levels of budgetary resources assumed for the account conducting the activity that generates the collections. when the level of collections is independent of the appropriated level, reflect collections consistent with the level of activity anticipated under current law. (f) multi-account appropriations if an appropriation covers more than one account and does not specify the amount provided for each account, such as the limitation on administrative expenses under the social security act, the distribution of the budget authority by account in the cy is the base for subsequent years. max inflates the cy amount by account to derive the budget authority for by through by+9. (g) accounts with negative budget authority in the cy ‚Ä¢ if the account has net negative budget authority in the cy as a result of a rescission, reduction, or transfer of balances, estimate the budget authority for by through by+9 as zero. prior to setting the budget authority for by through by+9 to zero, contact your omb representative to request that the max automatic calculator be turned off for this row. ‚Ä¢ if the account has negative budget authority because the offsetting collections credited to the account exceed the spending authority from those offsetting collections (e.g., as a result of limitations on administrative expenses or repayments of debt), provide your best estimate of the offsetting collections under current law, and ‚Ä¢ if the spending authority is controlled by appropriations, project the authority using the guidance in section 80.3(b). ‚Ä¢ if the spending authority from offsetting collections is indefinite, reflect the level of activity anticipated under current law. 80.4 what rules apply to mandatory spending and collections? section 257 of bbedca requires the estimates for budgetary resources provided in authorizing law and for appropriated entitlements to reflect the level of activity anticipated under current law, using the budget‚Äôs economic and technical assumptions. include the effect of changes to programs and activities directed by omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 3 of section 80 section 80‚Äîdevelopment of baseline estimates previously enacted legislation (such as a change in a benefit formula that becomes effective in by+2) in the year that the changes become effective. the following special rules apply: ‚Ä¢ expiring authorizations. assume that a program explicitly designated as temporary will expire in the baseline if the program was enacted after the balanced budget act of 1997. assume that programs scheduled to expire under current law (even if not explicitly designated as temporary) will expire in the baseline if current year outlays for the program are $50 million or less. assume that all other expiring programs will continue in the baseline if current year outlays exceed $50 million. for programs with definite ba, extend the ba at the same level authorized in the last full year, and for programs with indefinite ba, project future ba and outlays based on the program‚Äôs eligibility criteria, benefit formulas, and other provisions in effect at the point of expiration. assume an expiring provision of law (in contrast to an expiring program) will expire if that assumption does not have the effect of terminating the basic program. when extending an expiring program in the baseline, exclude the effects of future sequestration from by through by+9. ‚Ä¢ veterans\\' compensation cost-of-living-adjustment (cola). assume enactment of a cola for veterans\\' compensation that is equal to the cola required by law for veterans\\' pensions. agencies affected by these special rules should contact their omb representative for guidance. you should base collections affected by federal pay rates on rates used for presidential policy, not on the levels of compensation assumed in the baseline for the pay-related portion of discretionary accounts. if a pay increase for the current year has not been enacted, you should assume a current year pay increase equal to the pay increase proposed for the current year in the previous president‚Äôs budget, unless otherwise directed by omb. similarly, if a presidential policy decision on the pay increase for the budget year has not been made, you should use the provisional pay increase for the budget year from section 32.1, unless otherwise directed. certain substantive changes to or restrictions on entitlement law or other mandatory spending law contained in appropriations laws (including changes in offsetting receipts or collections) shall be treated as changes in discretionary spending for the purposes of scoring those appropriations laws (see section 21 and appendix a). however, in the subsequent budget, omb can decide to reclassify such changes, especially in accounts that are generally mandatory. if advised by omb to reclassify the change, the mandatory spending entries for the account should reflect the change made in appropriations law. sequestration of mandatory resources should be reflected in max for sequestration taking effect up through the current year (that is, through the 2020 sequestration order for purposes of the estimates in the 2021 president‚Äôs budget). sequestration for the budget year and beyond (which will be ordered in sequestration reports filed with the upcoming and future president‚Äôs budgets) will be handled centrally by omb and should not be reflected in the baseline. temporary reductions of budgetary resources sequestered in revolving, trust, or special fund accounts, or offsetting collections sequestered in appropriations accounts, that are determined by omb to become available in a subsequent fiscal year without further legislative action should be included in the baseline for the fiscal year in which they become available. see section 100.14 for more information on showing these resources in budgetary reporting. 80.5 what rules apply to mandatory supplemental requests? baseline estimates for mandatory supplemental requests will reflect current year baseline estimates of budget authority and the related outlays insofar as that budget authority will finance obligations that exist under current law. budget authority estimates for by through by+9 will be zero. however, you should reflect the spendout of current year budget authority, as appropriate, over the period by through by+9. page 4 of section 80 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 80‚Äîdevelopment of baseline estimates 80.6 what rules apply to governmental receipts? governmental receipts should be projected based on provisions of the tax code under current law, except that excise taxes dedicated to trust funds are assumed to continue after their scheduled expirations. (these receipts will not necessarily be carried over in policy if the trust fund spending is assumed to expire.) thus, estimates should include the effect of changes to governmental receipts directed by previously enacted legislation (such as a change in a tax rate, deduction, or credit that becomes effective in by+2) in the year that the changes become effective. 80.7 what materials must i provide in support of baseline estimates? after final budget decisions, you may be required to submit a table showing the impact on the baseline of estimates for some or all of the following: ‚Ä¢ major regulations; ‚Ä¢ expiring provisions of law or programs assumed to be extended in the baseline; ‚Ä¢ expiring provisions of law or programs not extended in the baseline; ‚Ä¢ caseloads for major mandatory programs; ‚Ä¢ management initiatives; ‚Ä¢ administrative actions; and ‚Ä¢ other major program assumptions included in the baseline. show the budgetary impact of each major assumption separately. for example, a change in outlays due to a regulatory change should be shown separately from a change due to the expiration of a provision of law. consult with your omb representative on the format and content of this table. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 5 of section 80 section 81‚Äîpolicy and baseline estimates of budget authority, outlays, and receipts (schedules a, s, r, and k) section 81‚Äîpolicy and baseline estimates of budget authority, outlays, and receipts (schedules a, s, r, and k) table of contents 81.1 81.2 81.3 what are the basic requirements? what data classifications do i use to enter data into max? what information do i need to report?

(i.e., discretionary, mandatory, net interest, governmental receipt) as a general rule, for offsetting collections from federal sources, you should classify any spending authority from offsetting collections, the offsetting collections from which they are derived, and the associated outlays as mandatory or discretionary based on the activities for which the offsetting collections are spent in the receiving account. this means the classification will have the same classification as the funding provided for similar activities being carried out by the account. for offsetting collections from non-federal sources (e.g. user fees), amounts should be classified as mandatory if the legislative language that creates the collection is in authorizing legislation or discretionary if the legislative language is in an appropriations act. ‚Ä¢ subcategory. includes subcategories from before discretionary enforcement expired in 2002 (e.g. third scorecard, highway, mass transit, non-emergency supplemental funding, and discretionary change in a mandatory program), as well as the cap adjustments included in the budget control act of 2011 (bca) page 2 of section 81 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 81‚Äîpolicy and baseline estimates of budget authority, outlays, and receipts (schedules a, s, r, and k) classification description (e.g., overseas contingency operations/global war on terrorism, emergency funding, program integrity, and disaster relief). report data by the categories listed in the next table, \"summary of budget enforcement data classifications.\" use multiple entries if more than one classification applies to the budgetary resources and outlays in an account. ‚Ä¢ jurisdiction. (appropriations or authorizing committee) all discretionary resources are under the jurisdiction of appropriations committees. the classification for mandatory resources differentiates between appropriations and authorizing committee jurisdiction. only accounts that have been approved by omb should include mandatory resources under the jurisdiction of the appropriations committees. ‚Ä¢ rescissions and cancellations. use an emergency, overseas contingency operations/global war on terrorism (oco/gwot), or disaster relief subcategory to classify rescissions and cancellations of amounts that have been designated as emergency, oco/gwot, or as disaster relief appropriations, respectively. reductions of funds that have been designated as emergency requirements will not be counted as paygo offsets for the purposes of the statutory pay-as-you-go act of 2010. reductions of funds that have been designated as emergency requirements, as oco/gwot appropriations, or as disaster relief will not be counted as discretionary offsets for appropriations of non-emergency funds. ‚Ä¢ other. the above rules apply to all line entries except the number of beneficiaries (line 5250-00). summary

schedule p is the program and financing schedule. it is printed in the budget appendix and presents information on agency programs, the allocation of budgetary resources by activity, the status of those resources, and spending patterns. the schedule covers py through by. it is used to: ‚Ä¢ analyze and evaluate the estimates; ‚Ä¢ compare enacted funding levels to the president\\'s request; ‚Ä¢ relate budget formulation to budget execution (estimates to actuals); and ‚Ä¢ identify programmatic and historical trends. schedule a shows budget authority (ba) and outlays by omb account for the most recent actual year (py), enacted levels for the current year (cy), and the levels proposed by the president for the budget year (by) through by+9. schedule s shows baseline estimates of ba and outlays by omb account and covers cy through by+9. to learn more about the additional data classifications you will use for schedules a and s, see section 81. 82.3 how is schedule x organized? schedule x follows the flow of the program and financing schedule (schedule p): ‚Ä¢ obligations by program activity (lines 0001‚Äì0900) (section 82.5) ‚Ä¢ budgetary resources (lines 1000‚Äì1966) (section 82.6) ‚Ä¢ change in obligated balance (lines 3000‚Äì3200) (section 82.7) ‚Ä¢ budget authority and outlays, net (lines 4000‚Äì4190) (section 82.8) ‚Ä¢ memorandum (non-add) entries (lines 5000‚Äì5250) (section 82.9) ‚Ä¢ unfunded deficiencies (lines 7000‚Äì7020) (section 82.10) the data you enter in the budgetary resources section and the budget authority and outlays, net section will automatically populate schedules p, a, and s. the remainder of the sections populate schedule p. the budgetary resources section is a common section used in schedule x, the sf133 report on budget execution, and the apportionment schedule. the change in obligated balance; the budget authority and outlays, net is used in schedule x and the sf133. page 2 of section 82 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 82‚Äîcombined schedule x 82.4 how are schedules a and s derived from schedule x? in the budgetary resources section, where schedule x shows the total for a type of ba (e.g., line 1160), you will also enter a more detailed breakout of budget authority and outlays used to populate schedules a and s. in the budget authority and outlays, net section, where schedule p shows offsets (e.g., line 4030), you will also enter a more detailed breakout of offsets for schedules a and s. you will do this by using more than one version of the line. for example, for total discretionary appropriations, you will use line x 1160 to populate schedule p, line x 1160‚Äì40 to populate schedule a, and line x 1160‚Äì50 to populate schedule s. since baseline and policy should be equal in cy for all data in transmit 0 and for by through by+9 in transmit 0 for mandatory receipts and spending, max will copy your data entry from baseline lines to policy. max will display a cy error if the amounts you enter in schedule x to populate the p and a schedules do not match the corresponding amounts that populate schedule a. schedules a and s also require that you associate outlays with your ba, so for each line of policy and baseline ba, you will show the associated outlays. these outlays are copied directly into schedules a and s, and are used to populate the budget authority and outlays, net section of schedule p. see exhibit 82b for more guidance on entering outlays. schedule p line numbers always have four digits. schedule a and s line numbers always have six digits. subtotals that appear only onscreen (i.e., do not print) also have 6 digits. this chart shows what the fifth and sixth digits in line numbers mean: max line and line numbers max schedule new budget authority and limitations: xxxx‚Äì40 policy program schedule a xxxx‚Äì50 baseline program schedule s outlays (policy): xxxx‚Äì61 outlays from new authority schedule a xxxx‚Äì62 outlays from balances schedule a xxxx‚Äì63 outlays from end of py balances schedule a xxxx‚Äì64 outlay subtotal schedule a outlays (baseline): xxxx‚Äì81 outlays from new authority schedule s xxxx‚Äì82 outlays from balances schedule s xxxx‚Äì83 outlays from end of py balances schedule s xxxx‚Äì84 outlay subtotal schedule s offsets: xxxx‚Äì41 policy program schedule a xxxx‚Äì71 baseline program schedule s omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 3 of section 82 section 82‚Äîcombined schedule x max line and line numbers max schedule other: xxxx‚Äì10 sum of detail lines xxxx‚Äì20 computed totals sum of the detail lines xxxx‚Äì30 pick list placeholders max displays these lines only in the pick lists for collapsible lines in schedule x. choose this line number when you want to enter a line with a new bea category, bea subcategory and spending committee (e.g., authorizing committee) code combination. 5250‚Äì00 number of beneficiaries (in thousands) schedule s use only with omb approval 82.5 how do i report obligations by program activity? the obligations by program activity section of schedule x, lines 0001‚Äì0900, shows the new obligations of unexpired accounts for each of the principle program activities or projects financed by the account (see section 20.5 for instructions on when to record obligations). direct obligations are shown on lines 0001‚Äì 0799, reimbursable obligations are shown on lines 0801‚Äì0899 (see section 83.5 for more on the distinction between direct and reimbursable obligations), and the 07xx series is reserved for credit-specific activities. the total direct and reimbursable obligations in this section must tie to the totals in schedule o, object classification. in transmit 0, all amounts in this section must be positive. (a) selecting program activities use activities that provide a constructive basis for analyzing and evaluating the estimates. keep the number of activities to a reasonable minimum without sacrificing clarity. do not use subactivities (such as projects or recipient institutions), unless the amounts are significant and the breakdown necessary to provide full understanding. the activities should: ‚Ä¢ clearly indicate the services to be performed or the programs to be conducted; ‚Ä¢ finance no more than one strategic goal or objective; ‚Ä¢ distinguish investment, developmental, grant and subsidy, and operating programs; and ‚Ä¢ relate to administrative control and operation of the agency. in cases where a single program activity line is used to group a variety of activities that do not lend themselves to a more specific description, the line title will start with the name of the account and indicate whether the obligations are direct or reimbursable, as follows: ‚Ä¢ account title (direct) ‚Ä¢ account title (reimbursable) page 4 of section 82 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 82‚Äîcombined schedule x this naming convention will better standardize and improve the program activity line descriptions reported in the budget. unless otherwise noted, you must: ‚Ä¢ distinguish direct obligations from reimbursable programs; and, ‚Ä¢ have adequate accounting support for obligations shown in the actual column. having adequate accounting support means that your agency\\'s financial system records obligations in a way that allows you to create a straight-forward cross-walk between the projects or limitations in the financial system and schedule x program activities. typically, you will have many projects or limitations in your financial systems that correspond to one schedule x activity. obtain approval for any changes in activity structure from omb prior to your budget submission. (b) allocating expenses to activities charge personnel compensation to activities on the basis of organizational units or on the basis of specific assignments. when feasible, distribute other administrative and overhead expenses among activities. however, you must be able to readily separate these overhead expenses from other charges. if you need to distribute amounts between two or more activities, base the distribution on readily supportable factors. be consistent from year to year, and do not rely on overly detailed procedures. do not report adjustments to obligations in expired accounts in this part of schedule x. report them under changes in obligated balance, on lines 3011 and 3041 (see section 82.5). (c) reimbursable programs if your account includes reimbursable obligations (see section 20.5), show the obligations financed by reimbursements separately from direct obligations. for classifying obligations as direct or reimbursable see section 83.5. report all the obligations in non-credit revolving fund accounts as reimbursable; report all the obligations in credit program and liquidating accounts as direct. (d) program activity codes program activity codes are unique to each account and have no relationship to the codes shown in other schedules, except for credit programs. for obligations specific to credit accounts, use the 07xx series, as specified in the list of line numbers at the end of this chapter. 82.6 how do i report the budgetary resources available for obligation? this section identifies the budgetary resources available for obligation in the account and provides detailed information on the new budget authority. this section is also used in the sf 133 report on budget execution and in the apportionment schedule. (a) unobligated balance the entries include unobligated balances carried over from prior years and adjustments to those amounts (such as transfers of balances to and from other budget accounts and recoveries resulting from downward adjustments of prior-year unpaid obligations). the unobligated balances reported on schedule x do not omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 5 of section 82 section 82‚Äîcombined schedule x include expired amounts or amounts unavailable for obligation. the end-of-year balances are shown as a memorandum entry on line 1941. (b) budget authority the entries indicate the type of budget authority (such as appropriations, contract authority, spending authority from offsetting collections) and whether the authority: ‚Ä¢ is discretionary or mandatory; and ‚Ä¢ pertains to a special or trust fund account. separate entries identify adjustments resulting from transfers, temporary and permanent reductions, capital transfers, repayments of outstanding borrowing, etc. discretionary budget authority means budget authority under the jurisdiction of appropriations committees and controlled by annual appropriations acts. it includes budget authority provided in appropriations acts except where such authority funds direct-spending programs, such as appropriated entitlements. use the appropriate discretionary entries to report budget authority that is classified as discretionary under the balance budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 (bbedca), see sections 20.4(e) and 81.3. mandatory budget authority means budget authority resulting from permanent laws and includes programs the bbedca defines as \"appropriated entitlements and mandatories,\" direct spending programs included in appropriations act such as the medicare program. use the appropriate mandatory entries to report all budget authority that is classified as mandatory under the bbedca, as well as budget authority that is classified as net interest. also use the appropriate mandatory entries to report budget authority associated with credit financing accounts. (c) entering policy and baseline budgetary resources data below is additional detail on entering the data into schedule x that will populate schedules a and s for budgetary resources and outlays. budgetary resources entry description 1160‚Äìxx to 1850‚Äìxx budget authority. includes total lines for each bea category (e.g., discretionary, mandatory,) for the different budgetary authority types (i.e., appropriations, advance appropriations, borrowing authority, contract authority, spending authority from offsetting collections). policy estimates of advance appropriations (line 1180) for by+2 and beyond will be set equal to by+1, unless omb approves as exception. 1963‚Äìxx to limitations. max includes data on limitations for selected accounts where limitations on 1966‚Äìxx program level or administrative expenses are enacted or proposed. limitation lines are also used, with omb approval, for special purposes, such as to report information on mandatory administrative expenses for the social security and medicare trust funds. the limitation(s) applicable to an account must be specified in advance in omb database of account information before you can report limitation data in max. when more than one limitation is applicable, report each one separately. supplemental requests and legislative proposals that involve limitations should be reported under the appropriate transmittal code. page 6 of section 82 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 82‚Äîcombined schedule x entry description mandatory budget authority that is subject to a discretionary limitation on obligations established in an appropriations act is scored as discretionary budget authority rather than as a limitation for all affected accounts except trust fund accounts in the department of transportation. xxxx‚Äì40 policy budget authority. the amounts on this line will be copied to schedule a. for discretionary policy budget authority and spending authority from offsetting collections, as a general rule, max automatically calculates entries for by+1 through by+9 based on the by budgetary resources entered by the agency and growth factors entered by omb. for discretionary spending authority from offsetting collections entries (line 1750), you may overwrite these amounts, if necessary. for mandatory budget authority and spending authority from offsetting collections, amounts will be copied from line xxxx‚Äì50 in transmittal code 0 only. xxxx‚Äì50 baseline budget authority. the amounts on this line will be copied to schedule s. as mentioned in section 81.2, amounts on this line should be broken out by civilian pay/ military pay/ non-pay. for discretionary baseline budget authority and spending authority from offsetting collections, as a general rule, max automatically calculates entries for by through by+9 based on the cy budgetary resources entered by the agency and growth factors entered by omb. for discretionary spending authority from offsetting collections (line 1750), you may overwrite these amounts, if necessary, to accurately reflect levels of activity anticipated under current law. for mandatory budget authority and offsetting collections, entries should reflect the levels of activity anticipated under current law. (d) entering policy and baseline outlay data discretionary outlays. max automatically calculates discretionary outlays (policy and baseline) for cy through by+9 based on the information reported in schedule x for: ‚Ä¢ the levels of budgetary resources reported; ‚Ä¢ the percentage of new ba that is outlayed in the year the ba is provided and in each subsequent year (outlay rate); and ‚Ä¢ outlays from py balances. you report outlay rates using the separate max drop down menu that is accessible for each budgetary resource, as described in the max a‚Äì11 user‚Äôs guide (see exhibit 82b). if necessary, you can report multiple outlay rates for the budgetary resources within an account, along with the corresponding outlays from py balances. to support the automatic outlay generation feature in max, you must enter information developed using the method of calculation (i.e., the waterfall method) that is specified in this circular and the max a‚Äì11 user‚Äôs guide (see exhibit 82c). as a general rule, you cannot override automatically generated discretionary outlay amounts. mandatory outlays. if you enter outlay rates for mandatory resources, max will automatically generate the outlays. remember to include information on outlays from py balances if you use the automatic feature. otherwise, you must enter mandatory outlays by hand for all years. a benefit of using outlay rates omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 7 of section 82 section 82‚Äîcombined schedule x to calculate outlays is that max will automatically generate revised outlays if you change the ba, saving you the work of calculating and entering revised outlay estimates. outlays from new and prior authority. outlays must be distributed between those from new authority and those from balances of prior authority. the distribution of prior authority should be available from accounting records. for cy through by+9, estimate the distribution based on experience in the timing of outlays for the respective obligations. the following line numbers indicate the type of outlays. you will enter these data in schedule x, and max will automatically copy them to schedules a and s. outlays policy baseline description xxxx‚Äì61 xxxx‚Äì81 outlays from new authority. the outlays from new budget authority for that year. for outlays from discretionary and mandatory authority, the sum of all outlays from new authority may not exceed the sum of new budget authority entries (lines 11xx through 16xx) for that year. for outlays from spending authority from offsetting collections, outlays may not exceed the total amount reported on lines 1750 and 1850. policy (xxxx‚Äì61) and baseline (xxxx‚Äì81) outlays from new authority will generally be the same for mandatory programs in all years and discretionary programs in the cy. discretionary policy outlays may be different from baseline outlays if budget authority amounts are different between the two. xxxx‚Äì62 xxxx‚Äì82 outlays from balances. the outlays from balances (both obligated and unobligated) of budget authority brought forward from cy to by+9. policy (xxxx‚Äì62) and baseline (xxxx‚Äì82) outlays from balances will generally be the same for mandatory programs in all years and discretionary programs in the by. discretionary policy outlays may be different from baseline outlays if budget authority amounts are different between the two. xxxx‚Äì63 xxxx‚Äì83 outlays from end of py balances. the outlays from balances (both obligated and unobligated) of budget authority brought forward from py. amounts should be shown in the year the outlay will be made, from cy to by+9. do not report outlays from new budget authority provided in cy to by+9. this line can also be used to display the outlay impact (+ or ‚Äì) of balance transfers (lines 1010 to 1031) and adjustments in expired accounts (line 3011, 3041). the sum of all years of the outlays from end of py balances lines (xxxx‚Äì63) should not exceed the total end of py balances plus py unpaid obligations, end of year, plus or minus cy and by balance transfers / adjustments. the amounts shown on baseline outlays from py balances (xxxx‚Äì83) will be copied from policy outlays from py balances (xxxx‚Äì63). 82.7 how do i report the change in obligated balances? obligated balances are composed of unpaid obligations (shown as positive amounts) and uncollected customer payments from federal sources (shown as negative amounts). unpaid obligations are obligations you have incurred but have not yet paid. uncollected customer payments are money you\\'re owed from federal sources plus orders that have been placed with you by federal sources, but you have not yet page 8 of section 82 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 82‚Äîcombined schedule x fulfilled. only if an account has explicit legal authority to count orders from non-federal sources as a budgetary resource may it do so. schedule x separately bridges between start and end of year unpaid obligations and uncollected customer payments from federal sources. for unpaid obligations, new obligations are added to the start of year balance, and gross outlays are deducted. adjustments, such as transfers of unpaid obligations are added or subtracted, as appropriate, and recoveries of prior-year unpaid obligations are subtracted to determine the unpaid obligations at the end of the year. for uncollected customer payments from federal sources, adjustments, such as transfers of uncollected payments and the change in uncollected customer payments from federal sources (both unexpired and expired), are added or subtracted, as appropriate, to determine the uncollected payments at the end of the year. in addition to reporting transactions in unexpired accounts, reflect outlays from and adjustments in expired (but not canceled) accounts. 82.8 how do i report budget authority and outlays, net? this section of schedule x bridges between gross and net budget authority and outlays. it begins with mandatory and discretionary gross budget authority and outlays. budget authority is reported for unexpired accounts only; outlays include both expired and unexpired accounts. outlays are distinguished between outlays from new authority and from balances. next, cash collections of offsetting collections are shown as negative amounts that offset both gross budget authority and gross outlays. following that are several items that further adjust only gross budget authority: changes in uncollected customer payments; offsetting collections credited to expired accounts; and recoveries of prior year paid obligations. (1) increases in uncollected customer payments from the start to the end of the year increase the amount of the offset (and are shown as negative amounts in this section) because the increase constitutes an increase in gross budget authority; decreases reduce the amount of the offset because a decrease means that a portion of the offsetting collections (cash) received has been applied to liquidate obligations for which an offset was already counted. (2) offsetting collections credited to expired accounts are shown as positive amounts here so that there is no total effect on budget authority of receiving a cash collection that is credited to an expired account. the amount on this line (line 4052 or 4142) and the amount in the cash collection line (e.g., 4030) have opposite signs and sum to zero. we do this because gross budget authority includes only unexpired amounts. (3) recoveries of prior-year paid obligations credited to unexpired accounts are shown as positive amounts here so that there is no total effect on budget authority of receiving a cash refund that is credited to an unexpired account. the amounts on this line (line 4053 or 4143) and the amount on the cash collection line (e.g., line 4030) have opposite signs and sum to zero. we do this because gross budget authority does not include recoveries of prior-year paid obligations. finally, net outlays are shown as the sum of gross budget authority and outlays and any applicable offsets. below is additional detail on entering the data into schedule x that will populate schedules a and s for offsets. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 9 of section 82 section 82‚Äîcombined schedule x offsets description entry 4030‚Äìxx to offsets against gross budget authority and outlays includes total lines for each bea category 4144‚Äìxx (e.g., discretionary, mandatory, see section 82.3 for line definitions) within the different sources of offsetting collections (e.g., federal sources, interest on federal securities, interest on uninvested funds, non-federal sources, offsetting governmental collections from non-federal sources, change in uncollected customer payments from federal sources unexpired accounts and offsetting collections credited to expired accounts and recoveries of prior-year paid obligations credited to unexpired accounts). xxxx‚Äì41 policy offsetting collections. the amounts on this line will be copied to schedule a. for discretionary policy offsetting collections, as a general rule, max automatically calculates entries for by+1 through by+9 based on the by amounts entered by the agency and growth factors entered by omb. you may overwrite these amounts, if necessary. xxxx‚Äì71 baseline offsetting collections. the amounts on this line will be copied from policy offsetting collections (xxxx‚Äì41) and will be copied to schedule s. for discretionary baseline offsetting collections, max automatically calculates entries for by through by+9 based on the cy amounts entered by the agency and growth factors entered by omb. 82.9 what memorandum information must i report on schedule x? lines 0910 and 0911 of schedule x display supplementary information related to amount of appropriations used to liquidate deficiencies of lease payments. use only with omb approval. while lines 1940 and 1941 of schedule x display supplemental information related to unobligated balances at the end of the fiscal year for all accounts, lines 1950 through 1955 specifically address unobligated balances of special and trust non-revolving trust funds including canceling amounts. lines 5000‚Äì5201 of schedule x display supplementary information related to investments in federal securities; investments in non-federal securities, balances of contract authority, unavailable unobligated balances (derived from appropriations, borrowing authority, contract authority, offsetting collections), and discretionary mandated transfers. in addition, certain accounts will use line 5250‚Äì00 to report on the annual average number of beneficiaries who are served by federal hospital insurance, supplementary medical insurance, unemployment insurance, and rail industry pension fund programs. max uses this data to generate discretionary baseline budget authority for administrative expenses for these programs. use only with omb approval. none of the amounts on the lines above are added or deducted from the budget authority or outlay amounts reported above. 82.10 how do i show unfunded deficiencies that have not been liquidated? section 145 explains prohibited agency actions under the antideficiency act and associated reporting requirements when a violation is discovered. page 10 of section 82 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 82‚Äîcombined schedule x lines 7000‚Äì7020 of schedule x identify unfunded deficiencies that have not yet been liquidated by either a new appropriation that specifically authorizes amounts to be applied to the deficiency or by the administrative application of other budgetary resources not expressly provided to liquidate deficiencies. 82.11 what control totals do i need to tie to? some of the data you enter into max needs to tie to control totals. the following list is not exhaustive: (a) controls reported by the agency the following is data that your agency has already reported. you must either tie to those controls, or, if appropriate, fix your other reporting: gtas. this data is drawn from the 4th quarter u.s. standard general ledger (ussgl) accounting information reported by your agency accounting office at the treasury appropriation fund symbol-level into a treasury-operated system named government-wide treasury account symbol adjusted trial balance system (gtas). in the 2021 budget, almost all the lines that are used to populate schedule x/p will be edit checked against your gtas submission. the py amounts on the edit checked schedule x/p lines must also equal the amounts reported in gtas within a +/-one or two million tolerance. the following types of lines are not edit checked against gtas: ‚Ä¢ individual obligations by program activities (x0001‚Äìx0899) ‚Ä¢ non-expenditure transfers, e.g. appropriation transfers from other accounts (‚Äì) (x1120) ‚Ä¢ specific max-generated detail entries, e.g. new obligations, unexpired accounts (x3010) ‚Ä¢ specific max-generated subtotals and totals, e.g., total discretionary appropriations (x1160) ‚Ä¢ specific memorandum (non-add) entries, e.g. unobligated balance, soy: contract authority (x5050) py net outlays (line x4190) and py receipts (schedule r). this data is drawn from the following budget execution documents: fs 224, fs 1219, and fs 1220. the data is loaded into max by omb and locked. the py net outlay amount on schedule x/p line 4190 must equal the net outlays reported in gtas within a +/-one million tolerance. ‚Ä¢ if you do not agree with the amount on line x/p 4190 \"outlays, net (discretionary and mandatory)\", after the gtas database is locked (late-october) and the amount is reported in gtas and imported into max a‚Äì11, then you must submit a written explanation of the difference to your omb representative before omb will consider revising the amount. since these types of issues generally require a revised statement of transactions, you must submit your explanation via a backdated treasury document request at https://max.omb.gov/community/x/6ylrhq. applies to gtas and non-gtas users. ‚Ä¢ follow the process in the bullet above if your agency does not agree with the receipt actuals that have been imported into max schedule r from treasury fs 224 data. (see section 81.1). receipt account information is not collected via gtas. non-federal securities (market value). line x5011, total investments, end of year: non-federal securities: market value is checked against amounts agencies report to treasury\\'s bureau of the fiscal service in business event type codes associated with the previous subclasses 42 and 43 on the statements of transactions. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 11 of section 82 section 82‚Äîcombined schedule x credit. for federal credit programs, credit subsidy cost data must match amounts approved by omb. control totals for schedule x reestimate and interest on reestimate obligations are verified against agency submissions to omb through the credit supplement report exercise (csr). for most programs, both control totals and schedule x obligation data for reestimates are automatically loaded into max, upon omb approval. start of year balances. start of year balances for investments in non-federal securities (x 5010) and the unavailable balance of offsetting collections (x 5054) are checked against the end of year amount shown in the previous budget. if you disagree with this number, provide an explanation to your omb representative for the discrepancy. (b) controls reported by treasury interest earnings on federal securities. lines x4031 and x4121, offsetting collections collected from interest on federal securities are checked against amounts reported by treasury\\'s bureau of the fiscal service. federal securities (par value). lines x5000 and x5001, total investments, start and end of year: federal securities: par value is checked against amounts reported by treasury\\'s bureau of the fiscal service. financing account interest. lines x0713 (obligations for payment of interest to treasury) and x4122 (offsetting collections from interest on uninvested funds) are checked against amounts reported by treasury\\'s bureau of the fiscal service for financing accounts only. capital transfers. lines x1022 (capital transfer of unobligated balances to general fund), x1235 (capital transfer of appropriations to general fund) and x1720/1820 (capital transfer of spending authority from offsetting collections to general fund) are checked against amounts reported by treasury\\'s bureau of the fiscal service. unobligated balance transfers between expired and unexpired accounts. line x1012 (unobligated balance transfers between expired and unexpired accounts) is checked against amounts reported by treasury\\'s bureau of the fiscal service. (c) controls reported by omb for both the formulation of the budget and for mid-session review, omb provides control totals for net discretionary levels. there are four types of edit checks which compare net discretionary levels in max to omb control totals. control total amounts are in whole millions. for each omb account, these lines are included in each type of check: ‚Ä¢ ba/obligation limitation: the sum of lines x1160, x1340, x1540, and x1966, which are associated with budget authority (excluding advance appropriations) and obligation limitations. ‚Ä¢ advance appropriation: line x1180 associated with advance appropriations. ‚Ä¢ spending authority and offsetting collections (net offset): the sum of line x1750 (discretionary spending authority and orders on hand) and lines x4030, x4031, x4032, x4033, x4034, x4050, x4052, x4053, and x4054 (offsetting collections) are compared to the net totals for each omb account. page 12 of section 82 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 82‚Äîcombined schedule x ‚Ä¢ offsetting receipts: the total for lines r2004-03 and r1330-03 for discretionary offsetting receipts. contact your omb representative about how to view reports comparing live max data to the omb discretionary control totals. cy net discretionary control totals. the omb control totals are based on bea scoring of enacted appropriations for cy. if there are no final enacted cy appropriations at the time, omb will make a determination as to what funding levels to include in the cy column. in some cases, omb\\'s control total may need to be updated (e.g., for updated offsetting collection or receipt estimates, for transfers, or for other technical updates). please contact your omb representative if a change is needed to a control total. you will need to provide a written explanation of the change and the enacted legislation supporting that explanation. by net discretionary controls for mid-session. the omb control totals will be the net discretionary levels from the president\\'s budget, with limited changes based on: ‚Ä¢ technical adjustments due to legislation enacted since the budget\\'s release ‚Ä¢ budget amendments formally transmitted to the congress ‚Ä¢ corrections submitted to omb\\'s errata database omb anticipates very few changes to the net by discretionary levels during mid-session. please contact your omb representative if you believe a change is needed to a control total. you will need to provide a written explanation of the change and the enacted legislation and/or budget appendix language supporting that explanation. 82.12 how do i resolve issues with my gtas control totals? (a) what actuals in schedule x are imported from the actual i reported to treasury? in order to reduce duplicate reporting while improving the consistency of year-end data, your agency accounting office reports u.s. standard general ledger (ussgl) accounting information at the treasury account-level into a treasury-operated system named governmentwide treasury account symbol adjusted trial balance system (gtas), which was developed by agencies, treasury, and omb. the gtas information is then translated/crosswalked and copied into the following reports: ‚Ä¢ sf 133 report on budget execution and budgetary resources (used to monitor sf 132 apportionments and used as the basis of the audited statement of budgetary resources); and ‚Ä¢ much of the py column of schedule p. ‚Ä¢ for more information about gtas and the ussgl and crosswalks from the ussgl to schedule p, see ussgl treasury financial manual (tfm) supplement located at http://www.fms.treas.gov/ussgl/index.html. when year-end gtas information is submitted, the information must not only pass a number of gtas edit-checks, but a person separate from the \"preparer\" (i.e. data entry person) named a \"certifier\" must certify that the information is correct. in addition, gao requires your auditors to determine whether controls exist to ensure that the amounts in your systems and the amounts submitted via gtas agree. see gao‚Äì02‚Äì126g \"guide for auditing the statement of budgetary resources\". omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 13 of section 82 section 82‚Äîcombined schedule x on a daily basis, treasury provides your agency with an account statement via the governmentwide accounting system. the account statement reflects all activity reported to treasury. you are required to reconcile the account statement with your accounting system each month. at year-end, this reconciliation should be accomplished before submitting your gtas data. during the preparation of the budget, refer to https://max.omb.gov/community/x/h4cpag for budget season gtas reports that include the following: ‚Ä¢ max a‚Äì11 issue status report ‚Äì gtas only ‚Ä¢ gtas submissions that will lead to errors in max ‚Ä¢ gtas suppression requests (link) ‚Ä¢ gtas revision reports (link) ‚Ä¢ gtas tafss revised after 4th quarter window ‚Ä¢ gtas tafss with budgetary changes ‚Ä¢ gtas tafss with budgetary and proprietary changes the following table summarizes the actions you need to take if max does not agree with gtas edit- checked amounts: if an error is found‚Ä¶ then‚Ä¶ before gtas and max a‚Äì11 agency lock-out and financial audit was ongoing or complete ‚Ä¢ consult with your accounting office. ‚Ä¢ correct the amount in max a‚Äì11. ‚Ä¢ ensure that your accounting office revises the amount in gtas. your accounting office must revise both material and non-material amounts in gtas. ‚Ä¢ work with your accounting office to determine the source of the problem and internally develop a plan to make sure the problem does not recur in the future. your accounting office will also need to talk with the financial statement auditors to determine whether your financial statements for the next reporting cycle should be restated or a footnote to the financial statements is required for the changes made in gtas. ‚Ä¢ for limited situations where there appears to be insufficient budgetary accounting to support the budget presentation, submit a py gtas-related suppression request to https://max.omb.gov/community/x/kqjufw. omb will review the suppression requests on a case-by-case basis. agency requests should include affected treasury appropriation fund symbol, max a‚Äì11 edit error, the amount of the adjustment in actual dollars, agency contact information, and an action plan that explores the various options to improve the budgetary accounting. after gtas and max a‚Äì11 agency ‚Ä¢ consult with omb representative. lock-out ‚Ä¢ submit a py gtas-related suppression request to and https://max.omb.gov/community/x/kqjufw for any situation where appropriate revisions were not made in the fy 2019 financial audit was on-going or gtas revision window. refer to section 82.12(d) below. complete page 14 of section 82 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 82‚Äîcombined schedule x if an error is found‚Ä¶ then‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¢ submit a cy gtas-related suppression request to https://max.omb.gov/community/x/kqjufw for any situation where the certified end of year unobligated and/or obligated balance(s) differ from the balances shown in max a‚Äì11. refer to section 82.12(d) below. ‚Ä¢ ensure that your accounting office revises the amount in gtas no later than 2nd quarter fy 2020 gtas reporting window for both py and cy changes. include a statement in your action plan of your gtas-related suppression request. your accounting office must revise both material and non- material amounts in gtas. ‚Ä¢ omb will review the suppression requests on a case-by-case basis. ‚Ä¢ the gtas revision window will be open to agency accounting offices at the same time agency budget offices are working on the actual column (py) data in the budget database. during this time, the gtas-related suppression request exercise (https://max.omb.gov/community/x/kqjufw) will also be available. agencies may prepare suppression requests during and after the gtas revision window. as a general rule, omb will not suppress any max a‚Äì11 edit-checks related to gtas data before the gtas revision window closes. while the gtas revision window is open, omb will use the revised gtas data in its edit checks. if your agency accounting office has made all the appropriate revisions in gtas, then your agency should have no edit-checks problems related to gtas. (b) what do i do if i do not agree with gtas non-edit-checked py amounts imported from treasury? you may over-write amounts imported from gtas that are not edit-checked. however, before overwriting an amount in the py column of schedule p in max a‚Äì11, you should talk with the person who entered the data into gtas to see why they entered that amount. if you both find that an amount reported via gtas was incorrect, then over-write the amount and let the person who entered the information in gtas know, so that they can revise it. this may indirectly impact other gtas data that is edit checked. (c) what do i need to do if a backdated treasury document is required to revise max to report corrections to data for previous fiscal years? if you have discovered an error in the budgetary reporting for a previous fiscal year, you may be required to record the correction as an adjustment to the data for the previous fiscal year, even though the action taken to correct the data occurs in the current year. this is because budgetary transactions must be booked against the fiscal year in which they were incurred so that they can be reconciled to the legal period of availability of the appropriations available at the time. where necessary, treasury will backdate the correction to the appropriate fiscal year, to prevent recording prior fiscal activity as current fiscal year activity. this is accomplished by filing a backdated treasury document (statement of transactions, non- expenditure transfer, or warrant), which shows both the date the correction is requested and a prior-year adjustment attribute to backdate the change to the correct period. if this also requires making a change to max data, then you are required to submit a request in the exercise (located at https://max.omb.gov/community/x/6ylrhq) and identify the appropriate information such as an explanation of why the error happened, affected treasury appropriation fund symbol, max a‚Äì11 edit omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 15 of section 82 section 82‚Äîcombined schedule x error, the amount of the adjustment in actual dollars, an action plan, and agency contact information. refer to appendix f for more details. once you have submitted your request and your backdated document in the exercise, you may monitor the status of your request via the exercise. you should get py-related matters like this taken care of as soon as the budget database opens so that you can concentrate on the by column later. the following table summarizes the actions you need to take to process a backdated treasury document: if an error is found‚Ä¶ then‚Ä¶ before gtas and max a‚Äì11 agency lock-out and financial audit was ongoing or complete ‚Ä¢ consult with your accounting office. ‚Ä¢ submit a backdated treasury document (statement of transactions, non-expenditure transfer, or warrant) request to https://max.omb.gov/community/x/6ylrhq. if your action impacts line x/p 4190 ‚Äúoutlays (net)‚Äù or receipt data, and your request is approved, line x/p 4190 or the receipt data will be centrally changed. ‚Ä¢ if the action impacts any line x/p other than line p 4190, ensure that your accounting office revises the amount in gtas. refer to section 82.11. your accounting office must revise both material and non-material amounts in gtas. ‚Ä¢ work with your accounting office to determine the source of the problem and internally develop a plan to make sure the problem does not recur in the future. your accounting office will also need to talk with the financial statement auditors to determine whether your financial statements for the next reporting cycle should be restated or a footnote to the financial statements is required for the changes made in gtas. after gtas and max a‚Äì11 agency lock-out and financial audit was on-going or complete ‚Ä¢ consult with omb representative. ‚Ä¢ submit a backdated treasury document (statement of transactions, non-expenditure transfer, and/or warrant) request to https://max.omb.gov/community/x/6ylrhq. if the action impacts line x/p 4190 \"outlays (net)\" or receipt data, and your request is approved, line x/p 4190 or the receipt data will be centrally changed where appropriate. ‚Ä¢ if the action impacts any line x/p other than line x/p 4190, submit a py gtas-related suppression request to https://max.omb.gov/community/x/kqjufw for any situation where appropriate revisions were not made in the fy 2019 gtas revision window. refer to section 82.12(d) below. ‚Ä¢ if the action impacts any line x/p other than line x/p 4190, submit a cy gtas-related suppression request to https://max.omb.gov/community/x/kqjufw for any situation where the certified end of year unobligated and/or obligated balance(s) differ from the balances shown in max a‚Äì11. refer to section 82.12 (d) below. omb will review the suppression requests on a case-by-case basis. page 16 of section 82 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 82‚Äîcombined schedule x (d) why do i need to revise gtas if i do not agree with py amounts imported from treasury? before the max a‚Äì11 agency lock-out, the gtas database opens for revisions. you must revise the incorrect information in gtas because the revised gtas database is used as a basis for revised sf 133s, audited statements of budgetary resources (if material), and central analysis. information is copied from gtas to max a‚Äì11 once per year before max a‚Äì11 opens to agency budget offices. however, information is never copied from max a‚Äì11 to gtas. revisions are intended to help you correct errors (not to give you extra time to verify your data) and should be used sparingly. the primary purpose of this revision period is to make gtas consistent with the amounts in the prior-year column of the budget. consult with the financial statement auditors to determine whether your financial statements for the next reporting cycle should be restated or a footnote to the financial statements is required for the changes made in gtas that result in differences between the statement of budgetary resources and the budget. for gtas reporting periods, see http://www.fms.treas.gov/factsii/. (e) what actions do i need to take if i changed amounts imported from gtas in max a‚Äì11 for the budget but did not change them in the gtas revision window? before omb will suppress any py or cy gtas-related edit error request, agencies must submit a suppression request to https://max.omb.gov/community/x/kqjufw and identify the appropriate information such as affected treasury appropriation fund symbol, max a‚Äì11 edit error, the amount of the adjustment in actual dollars, an action plan, and agency contact information. if the changes do not affect ending balances (e.g., changes to discretionary versus mandatory coding), you do not need to make changes in gtas in the next fiscal year gtas reporting window. for example, if you changed an appropriation from mandatory to discretionary, this change does not impact the ending balances. therefore, no change is required in gtas after the revision window has closed. if the changes affect ending balances (e.g., changes to amounts of budget authority, new obligations and upward adjustments, gross outlays, beginning balances), you will need to make changes in gtas in the next fiscal year gtas reporting window. you should consult with the person who entered the data into gtas. if you both agree that the amount should have been revised in gtas, then the person who entered the information in gtas should adjust the appropriate beginning balances (whether material or non- material) in the next fiscal year gtas reporting window. for example, if you increased the amount of new obligations (but not disbursed) by 100, then the ending unobligated balance would decrease by 100, and the obligated balance would increase by 100. therefore, the beginning unobligated balance reported in the preceding fiscal year gtas reporting window should be decreased by 100, and the beginning obligated balance reported in the preceding fiscal year gtas reporting window should be increased by 100. until changes are made in both gtas and max a‚Äì11, there will be an ongoing difference in the balances reported in gtas and the budget. (f) how can i prepare? actuals reported in the budget must be consistent with amounts reported to treasury and must be based on actual accounting data. review any differences from last year\\'s actuals reported to treasury at https://max.omb.gov/community/x/haaqaw to prevent these differences from reoccurring. the website also includes reports that show fy 2019 quarterly gtas submissions and how they would crosswalk into schedule p. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 17 of section 82 section 82‚Äîcombined schedule x typically, one group within your agency (for example, the accounting office) reports amounts to treasury (see section 130.2), while another group (for example, the budget office) prepares budget schedules. before your accounting office submits its actuals to treasury in gtas (described below), you must ensure that the amounts are conceptually and numerically consistent with the amounts that you are going to report in max a‚Äì11. gtas facilitates, and to a large extent eliminates the need for, this reconciliation. consult with your accounting office for any differences that you are aware of and review your obligations and balances reported on your quarterly sf 133 throughout the year. also, review any differences from last year at https://max.omb.gov/community/x/haaqaw to prevent these differences from reoccurring. 82.13 what amounts in schedule x need to tie to other schedules? the data you enter into schedule x needs to tie to data in other schedules. the following list is not exhaustive: (a) other schedules in the same account all accounts, not including financing accounts ‚Ä¢ schedule o (obligations): the total obligations you report in the obligations by program activities section of schedule x must equal the total obligations you report in schedule o, the object classification schedule. in addition, the breakdown of direct vs. reimbursable obligations must be the same as in o, with a small rounding tolerance. ‚Ä¢ schedule c (net ba and outlays): net policy ba and outlays you report in schedule x must match, by subfunction, the net ba and outlays reported in schedule c, the character classification schedule. if you have only one ba line and one outlay line in schedule c, max will generate these amounts for you. ‚Ä¢ schedule t (pre-transfer appropriations): the pre-transfer policy ba you report in schedule x as controlled by the appropriations committee must match the ba you report in schedule t, the schedule for the budget year appropriations request in thousands of dollars. credit accounts only ‚Ä¢ schedule u (obligations and outlays): in credit program accounts, the obligations you report on lines 0701‚Äì0709 in schedule x must tie to schedule u. in addition, the gross outlays you report in schedule u cannot exceed the gross outlays you report in schedule x on lines xxxx‚Äì61, xxxx‚Äì62, and xxxx‚Äì63. ‚Ä¢ schedules g and h (obligations): in credit financing accounts, obligations you report on lines 0710‚Äì 0744 in schedule x must tie to schedule g for direct loan financing accounts or schedule h for guaranteed loan financing accounts. ‚Ä¢ schedule y (net financing disbursements): in credit financing accounts, the net financing disbursements you report on line 4190 of schedule x must match the policy net financing disbursements you report in schedule y. (b) schedules in other accounts ‚Ä¢ non-expenditure transfers: when you enter a line in schedule x for a non-expenditure transfer to or from another account, you must enter the primary treasury account code associated with that page 18 of section 82 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 82‚Äîcombined schedule x account. the amounts you enter for your account must match the amounts entered in the other account for py through by. ‚Ä¢ credit accounts: transactions between program accounts, financing accounts, and receipt accounts for the same program must match. for example, if the program account reports negative subsidies in schedule u on lines x341‚Äì99, the same amount must be reported in the associated financing accounts on line 0740 in schedule x and in the associated negative subsidy receipt account. ‚Ä¢ interfund account: for general fund accounts that make payments to trust fund accounts, the amounts paid by the general fund account must match the amounts received by the trust fund account. 82.14 how do i present transfers of resources? transfers between agencies resulting from presidential reorganization plans or enacted reorganization legislation may involve unique problems. agency staff must consult with omb representatives in each instance. when the gaining agency assumes all of the activities previously financed under a single account in another agency, as a general rule, the losing agency should omit budget schedules and appropriation language for the affected account and the gaining agency should show the transferred activities and appropriation language with its schedules. use footnotes to identify the amounts involved. (see section 82.13 for an example of how the footnote should be worded and section 95 for guidance on submitting the footnotes for printing.) 82.15 how do i present transfers in the estimates? when a transfer in the estimates (see section 20.4(k)) for the budget year results in a significant increase to or decrease from the amount of budget authority for the past or current year, include footnotes explaining the transfer after the program and financing schedule. (see section 95 for guidance on submitting the footnotes for printing.) for the account assuming the responsibility, use the following footnote: note‚Äîincludes $_million in budget authority in by for activities previously financed from: py cy [list the full title of each losing account, including agency and bureau, and the budget authority amount applicable to each. where it is appropriate to show the amount on some other basis, such as obligations, you may modify the footnote accordingly.] if the entire by estimate is for the transferred activity, the footnote may be worded, \"by estimate is for activities previously financed from [list agency, bureau, and account title].\" for the account losing the activity, use the following footnote: note‚Äîexcludes $_million in budget authority in by for activities transferred to: [list the title of each gaining account, including agency and bureau, and the budget authority amount applicable to each. where it is more appropriate to show the amount on some other basis, such as obligations, modify the footnote accordingly.] comparable amounts for py ($_million) and cy ($_million) are included above. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 19 of section 82 section 82‚Äîcombined schedule x you only need to provide a transfer in the estimates footnote in the year the transfer proposal is made. if you use more than one footnote, include them under a centered heading, \"notes.\" modify the wording of footnotes as necessary to explain current year transfers. at the discretion of omb, transfers in the estimates may be shown on a three-year comparable basis. if they are, the footnotes should be modified accordingly. 82.16 how do i present merged accounts? where two or more appropriations have been or are proposed to be replaced by a single appropriation (see section 79.4(i)), submit a single set of schedules for the new appropriation. when you merge accounts, you may find it helpful to append a distribution of budget authority and outlays by account to the bottom of the program and financing schedule. for accounts where you have created a distribution table, list each merged budget account by name and provide data for py through by. 82.17 how should i treat allocation accounts? combine schedule p information for allocation accounts with the parent account without separate identification (see section 20.4(l)). 82.18 what should i know about the individual lines in schedule x? use the entries in the following tables to prepare the individual lines in schedule x. max will automatically generate the line entries indicated in bold face. obligations by program activity this section only includes obligations by program activity in unexpired treasury appropriation fund symbols. entry max details all accounts: 0xxx the first digit will always be zero (0). non-credit programs: the line codes are unique to each account and have no relationship to information shown in other schedules. direct programs (0001‚Äì0799): 0xxx 0xxx for the second digit, use the values 0 through 7 to identify the activity or subactivity group. for the third and fourth digits, use the values 01 through 89 to identify activity or subactivity detail items. any number sequence in this range is valid. for subtotals, use the values 91 through 98 as follows: ‚Ä¢ xx91‚Äîsubtotal for a single group of detail lines (e.g., 0001‚Äì0089) ‚Ä¢ xx92‚Äîsubtotal of two groups of detail lines (e.g., 0001‚Äì0189) ‚Ä¢ xx93‚Äîsubtotal of three groups of detail lines (e.g., 0001‚Äì0289) use the value 0x00 for running subtotals (e.g., 0500 = the sum of detail lines 0001‚Äì 0489). page 20 of section 82 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 82‚Äîcombined schedule x entry max details reimbursable programs (0800‚Äì0899): 08xx

changes clarifies the classification of interest paid to vendors for late payment (section 83.6) 83.1 what are object classes? object classes are categories in a classification system that presents obligations by the items or services purchased by the federal government. these are the major object classes: ‚Ä¢ 10 personnel compensation and benefits ‚Ä¢ 20 contractual services and supplies ‚Ä¢ 30 acquisition of assets ‚Ä¢ 40 grants and fixed charges ‚Ä¢ 90 other we divide these major classes into smaller classes and present them in the budget appendix in object class schedules. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 1 of section 83 section 83‚Äîobject classification (max schedule o) the object classes present obligations according to their initial purpose, not the end product or service. for example, if you pay a federal employee who constructs a building, classify the obligations for the employee\\'s wages under personnel compensation and benefits, rather than acquisition of assets. if you purchase a building, classify the contractual obligations under acquisition of assets. you record obligations when the federal government places an order for an item or a service, awards a contract, receives a service, or enters into similar transactions that will require payments in the same or a future period (see section 20.5). you also record obligations when you make an expenditure transfer between federal government accounts (see section 20.4(j)). 83.2 why must i report object class information? you must report object class information because the law (31 u.s.c. 1104(b)) requires the president\\'s budget to present obligations by object class for each account. 83.3 how do object classes compare to functional and character classes and program activity? the following table shows how the object classification system differs from the other classification systems used in the president\\'s budget. classification system what is classified? what does it tell me? object class obligations goods or services or items purchased, for example, supplies, rent, or equipment program activity (see section 82.5) obligations activity, project, or other programmatic distinction

84.4) budget authority, outlays, and offsetting receipts whether the amount pays for an investment or noninvestment and whether the amount is a grant to a state and local government or a direct federal program; if investment, then, what type: physical asset, conduct of r&d, or conduct of education and training 83.4 how does the object class schedule relate to the program and financing schedule? you report object class information whenever you report obligations on a program and financing (p&f) schedule (except you do not report object class information for credit financing accounts). this means you report obligations by object class separately for the regular budget requests, supplemental budget requests, rescission proposals, and legislative proposals. in addition, object class schedules separately identify the following types of obligations: ‚Ä¢ direct and reimbursable obligations (see section 83.5). ‚Ä¢ obligations between agencies (see section 83.14). 83.5 how can i determine whether an obligation should be classified as direct or reimbursable? page 2 of section 83 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 83‚Äîobject classification (max schedule o) in general, reimbursable obligations are those financed by offsetting collections (see section 20.7(d)) received in return for goods and services provided, while all other obligations are direct.

wages paid to the employees (some of which may be withheld from the employee\\'s check to pay taxes, to pay a bill in a credit union, or to pay the employee\\'s share of life and health insurance). ‚Ä¢ other payments that become part of their basic pay (for example, geographic differentials, and critical position pay). ‚Ä¢ regular salaries and wages paid while the employees are on paid leave, such as annual, sick, or compensatory leave. ‚Ä¢ lump sum payments for annual leave upon separation (also known as terminal leave payments). exclude: ‚Ä¢ compensation above the basic rate, for example, overtime or other premium pay, which will be classified in object class 11.5, other personnel compensation. ‚Ä¢ full-time temporary employees who are full-time civilian employees with temporary appointments as defined by opm who will be classified in object class 11.3, other than full-time permanent. regular salaries and wages paid to civilian employees for part-time, temporary, or intermittent employment (see note below). include: ‚Ä¢ part-time permanent employees, that is, employees with appointments that require work on a prearranged schedule of fewer hours or days of work than prescribed for full-time employees in the same group or class. ‚Ä¢ temporary employees, that is, employees with appointments for a limited period of time that is generally less than a year. for

appointments and advisory committees. ‚Ä¢ intermittent employees, that is, employees with appointments that require work on an irregular or occasional basis and who are paid only for the time actually employed or services actually rendered. note: for personal services contracts with individuals, who are classified by opm as federal employees, classify the basic pay in this object class and classify compensation above the basic pay in object class 11.5, other personnel compensation. on the other hand, classify the payments to a contractor principally for the personal services of a group of the

hazardous duty pay, which is pay above the basic rate because of assignments involving performance of duties that subject the employee to hazards or physical hardships. note: post differentials and hazardous duty pay result from the job or services performed. for example, a job performed at a hardship post abroad or under hazardous duty is different from what might appear to be the same job performed elsewhere and under non-hazardous conditions. hence, both are classified with other pay in object class 11 and not as benefits in object class 12. by contrast, compensation in the form of cost of living allowances are classified as benefits in object class 12 because they do not result from the job or services performed. the cost for a job in one locale is different from the same job in another locale simply because the cost of living is higher in one locale. ‚Ä¢ supervisory differential, which is pay above the basic rate to adjust the compensation of a supervisor to a level

assigned temporarily to a non-federal organization. ‚Ä¢ detailed federal employees. a detailed federal employee continues to receive pay, allowances, and benefits from the federal agency. in some cases, these costs are reimbursed by the non-federal organization. ‚Ä¢ federal employees on leave without pay (lwop). a federal employee on lwop is paid by the non-federal organization to which he or she is assigned. the salary paid by the non-federal organization may be more or less than the employee\\'s current federal salary. if the rate of pay of the non-federal organization is less, then the federal agency may pay a supplemental salary to the employee. also under the ipa, an employee of a non-federal organization may be assigned temporarily to a federal agency either (1) with a temporary federal appointment or (2) on detail. ‚Ä¢ non-federal employees with temporary federal appointments. a non-federal employee with a temporary federal appointment is paid by the federal agency to which he or she is assigned. however, he or she is eligible to enroll in the federal employees health benefits program only if the federal appointment results in the loss of coverage under the non-federal health benefits system. he or she is not covered by any retirement system for federal employees or by the federal employees group life insurance program. page 28 of section 83 omb circular no. a‚Äì11

salary of the employee on detail is less than the minimum rate of pay for the federal position, the federal agency may supplement the salary to make up the difference. cost-sharing arrangements for ipa assignments are negotiated between the participating organizations. the federal agency may agree to pay all, some, or none of the costs associated with an assignment. these include basic pay, supplemental pay, fringe benefits, and travel and relocation expenses. because of these cost-sharing arrangements you should use the following table to classify these obligations. if the obligations

do i classify obligations for tricare benefits for uniformed service members? tricare is a regionally administered program which provides healthcare for uniform service members, retirees, survivors, and their families. this program combines healthcare resources of the air force, army, and navy while enhancing them with a variety of civilian healthcare professionals. the national defense authorization act replaces annual appropriations to the military personnel accounts of the department of defense (dod) with permanent, indefinite appropriations from the general fund of omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 29 of section 83 section 83‚Äîobject classification (max schedule o) the treasury. the tricare accrual payments are made at the beginning of each year, instead of at the end of each month, and will be based on planned troop levels within the enacted dod budget, instead of on the actual number of military personnel at the end of each month. the funding is shown in separate accounts for the army, the navy, the marine corps, the air force, the army reserve, the navy reserve, the marine corps reserve, the air force reserve, the army national guard and the air force national guard. these accounts will, in turn, pay the accruals to the dod medicare-eligible retiree health care fund. tricare benefits are earned by all current uniformed service members not just those in the dod. this means that accounts for the commissioned corps in the public health service in the department of health and human services, the united states coast guard in the department of homeland security, and the commissioned corps in the national oceanic and atmospheric administration in the department of commerce will also pay the accruals to the dod medicare-eligible retiree health care fund. in turn, the dod medicare-eligible retiree health care fund pays the health benefits for retired members of the uniformed service. if the obligations are ... then classify in object class ... the employing agency contributions by the department of defense (dod), the department of health and human services, the department of homeland security, and the department of commerce to the

only.‚Äù 42.0 insurance, claims, and indemnities 83.17 how is object class information presented in max schedule o and the appendix? you must first enter all object class information in max schedule o in order to populate the appendix with object class data. the appendix presents object class information in tables called object class schedules, which display the object class codes, the object class titles, and the amounts of obligations in the past, current, and budget year. max schedule o. object class data are displayed in max on the basis of a 4‚Äìdigit line number followed by a 2-digit line serial number. the 4-digit line number is made up of a prefix and a 3-digit object class code. the prefix for direct obligations is 1xxx and for reimbursable obligations is 2xxx. see exhibit 83a for a list of the 3-digit object class codes. page 30 of section 83 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 83‚Äîobject classification (max schedule o) note: the 3-digit object class code in max schedule o is the same 3-digit object class code in the appendix, except that in the appendix there is a decimal before the last digit. see section 83.7 for the definitions of the object classes. appendix schedules. the object class schedules in the appendix present the 3-digit object class codes and the object class titles. normally, the appendix will include a separate object class schedule for each p&f schedule that reports obligations (see exhibits 83b). however, when all obligations in a p&f schedule are classified in a single object class, there will be no object class schedule in the appendix. instead, the code for the appropriate object class will be identified in the p&f schedule in parentheses at the end of the line for total new obligations, unexpired accounts. for example, if all obligations in a p&f are for grants, then \"(object class 41.0)\" will be at the end of the stub entry on line 10.00 of the p&f. although there will be no object class schedule printed in the appendix, you must enter the data in max schedule o. normally, the appendix includes only one object class line for each object class code and uses the standard titles listed in section 83.7. the default 2-digit line serial number is 01. however, you may insert additional object class lines in max and edit the standard titles. for example, to present employee travel separately from grantee travel in object class 21.0, travel and transportation of persons, you may insert another line in max schedule o, edit the standard titles, and distribute the obligations between the two lines. allocations between agencies. in some cases, funds appropriated to the president or to an agency are allocated to one or more agencies that help to carry out the program. obligations incurred under such allocations are included in the data for the account to which the appropriation was made in the allocating agency, that is, the parent account. the parent account must enter the data in max schedule o. the parent account may use additional object class lines (as described above) to separately present the parent and allocation account activity. 83.18 when i report data in max schedule o will it generate subtotals or totals? yes. max will generate subtotals for different types of obligations from the amounts that you entered, as follows: ‚Ä¢ for reimbursable obligations (lines 2xxx), max will automatically generate a subtotal line 2990 when you enter at least one amount on lines 2xxx. ‚Ä¢ for direct obligations (lines 1xxx), max will automatically generate a subtotal line 1990 when you enter more than one amount on lines 1xxx max will generate \"total new obligations, unexpired accounts\" on line 9999, when you enter more than one amount above this line. omb circular no.

ex‚Äì84 summary of character classification codes (schedule c) summary of changes provides new guidance on reporting character classification in trust funds (section 84.3). provides new guidance on reporting historical character classification data when a correction is made (section 84.3). 84.1 what is the purpose of the character classification system? character classification is used to distinguish between funding for investment and non-investment activities in the budget and also to distinguish funding for grants-in-aid from funding for direct federal programs. character classification is used to capture gross spending on these activities even when they are financed by offsetting collections within an account. character classification is recorded in schedule c of max a11 data entry (max). see exhibit 84 for a summary of character classification line numbers in schedule c and see section 79 for more information about max generally. the data entered in schedule c are used in the production of tables for the historical tables volume of the budget as well as special analysis in the budget. 84.2 what are the different character classifications and how are they used? investment activities in schedule c are coded as construction and rehabilitation (lines 1311-1314); major equipment (lines 1321-1324); commodity inventories (line 1330); purchases and sales of land and structures for federal use (line 1340); other physical assets (lines 1351-1352); conduct of research and development (lines 1411-1432); and conduct of education and training (lines 1511-1512). non-investment activities are coded as grants, other than shared revenues (line 2001); grants, shared revenues (line 2003); and direct federal programs (line 2004). in every classification series, grants are coded on odd numbered lines while direct federal programs are coded on even numbered lines. see section 84.4 for detailed descriptions of all of the line numbers that you must use to report character classification.

(d) conduct of education and training (character class codes 15xx) conduct of education and training includes veterans\\' education and training; operating assistance for elementary, secondary, vocational, adult, and higher education; agricultural extension services; and income support activities directly contingent upon participating in such programs. this character classification excludes training of military personnel or other persons in government service. (e) grants to state and local governments, also known as grants-in-aid (character class codes xxx1 or xxx3) for preparing character classification data, state or local governments include the following: ‚Ä¢ the 50 states and the district of columbia. ‚Ä¢ cities, counties, townships, municipalities, school districts, special districts, and other local governmental units, as defined by the bureau of the census. ‚Ä¢ puerto rico, the virgin islands, and other u.s. territories. ‚Ä¢ the federated states of micronesia, marshall islands, and palau, if the payments are in an account that has grants to other state or local governments. ‚Ä¢ indian tribal governments when: ‚Ä¢ the legislation authorizing the payment includes such entities within the definition of eligible state or local units. ‚Ä¢ the tribal government acts as a nonprofit agency operating under state or local auspices. ‚Ä¢ quasi-public nonprofit entities, such as community action agencies, when the boards of such entities must either be elected in state or local elections, or must include significant representation of state or locally elected officials. report budget authority and outlays as grants to state and local governments if the federal government\\'s resources support state or local programs of government operations or provision of services to the public. for reporting character classification data for grants, include the following: page 4 of section 84 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 84‚Äîcharacter classification (schedule c) ‚Ä¢ direct cash grants to state or local governmental units, to other public bodies established under state or local law, or to their designee. ‚Ä¢ payments for grants-in-kind, such as purchases of commodities distributed to state or local governmental institutions (e.g., school lunch programs). ‚Ä¢ payments to nongovernmental entities when such payments result in cash or in-kind services or products that are passed on to state or local governments, for example, payments to the corporation for public broadcasting, or to the american printing house for the blind. ‚Ä¢ payments to regional commissions and organizations that are redistributed at the state or local level to provide public services. ‚Ä¢ payments to state and local governments for research and development that is an integral part of the state and local governments\\' provision of services to the general public (e.g., research on crime control financed from law enforcement assistance grants, or on mental health associated with the provision of mental rehabilitation services; see discussion below for exclusions related to research and development and payments for services rendered). ‚Ä¢ direct loan or loan guarantee subsidies to state or local governments. ‚Ä¢ shared revenues. these include payments to state or local governments that are computed as a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of certain federal property, products, or services (e.g., payments from receipts of oregon and california grant lands). tax or other collections by the federal government that are passed on to state or local governments (e.g., internal revenue collections for puerto rico) are also included. exclude the following: ‚Ä¢ federal administrative expenses associated with grant programs. ‚Ä¢ grants directly to profit-making institutions, individuals, and nonprofit institutions not covered above, for example, payments to job corps centers and trainees. ‚Ä¢ payments for research and development not directly related to the provision of services to the general public, for example, basic research awarded via competitive grants. ‚Ä¢ payments for services rendered, for example, utility services, training programs and expenses for federal employees, research and development for federal purposes conducted under contracts, grants, or agreements by such agencies as the national institutes of health (nih), the national science foundation (nsf), the department of energy (doe), the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa), and the department of defense (dod). ‚Ä¢ federal grants to cover administrative expenses for regional bodies and other funds not redistributed to the states or their subordinate jurisdictions (e.g., the administrative expenses of the appalachian regional commission). (f) direct federal programs (character class codes xxx0, xxx2, or xxx4) federal programs that are not classified as grants to state and local governments will be classified as direct federal programs. direct federal programs include both programs operated directly by federal employees omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 5 of section 84 section 84‚Äîcharacter classification (schedule c) and programs operated through contract or by grants to non-federal entities not included in the definition of \"state and local governments\" under (e). 84.3 what do i need to know about reporting the data and relationships with other data requirements? (a) general requirements ‚Ä¢ if an account has only one character class code, max will automatically generate the amounts for schedule c. ‚Ä¢ omb does not control centrally the addition or deletion of character classification codes of expenditure accounts. if the nature of an account changes or otherwise requires the use of different character classes, you may add (or delete) the appropriate code and enter gross budget authority and outlays in max in that code without advance approval from omb. ‚Ä¢ report gross budget authority and gross outlays on character classification lines 1311-2003. use line 2004 to capture non-investment and non-grant amounts, as well as non-investment offsetting collections, and balance the totals for schedule c with net ba and outlay amounts in schedule x. ‚Ä¢ report rescissions on the same line as the original funding. for example, if funding appropriated for the construction of a new federal facility is rescinded, the funding and the rescission should be recorded on line 1314. ‚Ä¢ budget authority and outlay totals for each subfunction must be consistent across all schedules and transmits. if an account has multiple subfunctions, report budget authority and outlays by subfunction. see section 81 for more information on entering estimates of budget authority, outlays, and receipts. ‚Ä¢ character classifications should be used consistently across all transmits, but can change to properly reflect program proposals (e.g., an account with investment funding on line 1512 under current law, could also have a mandatory proposal for a new grant on line 1511 in a transmit 4). ‚Ä¢ if a transaction fits into more than one classification, report it in the classification category with the lowest numerical character classification code. for example, record amounts for construction of research and development facilities in the appropriate 13xx grouping, not in the 14xx grouping. ‚Ä¢ if an account contains activities that fall under two or more character classifications, omit any classification involving less than $1 million in each of the three fiscal years (py, cy, and by), and include the amounts in the next largest classification in that particular account. ‚Ä¢ when entering a new grant line (an odd numbered line) in schedule c, the correct budget enforcement act (bea) category (i.e. discretionary or mandatory) for those amounts should be selected. the bea category for amounts on non-grant lines is not recorded in schedule c. ‚Ä¢ in some cases, grants to state and local governments allow the recipient jurisdiction the option of using funds for current or investment-type purposes, such as in community development block programs. in such instances, record all of the budget authority and outlays for grants in the category where the majority of the funds are anticipated to be used. page 6 of section 84 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 84‚Äîcharacter classification (schedule c) ‚Ä¢ avoid double counting. if an appropriation is made to a federal fund and transferred to a trust fund, only code the funding as investment once in the account that makes the investment (usually the trust fund). see also (c) below. ‚Ä¢ if a correction in the max a-11 database to the character classification of current or prior year funding is necessary, it is required that the agency also provide corrected historical amounts for years prior to the current budget exercise‚Äôs py. (b) reporting offsetting collections (expenditure accounts) in almost all cases, offsetting collections in the account should be included in character class direct federal programs, non-investment as part of a net total on line 2004. an exception would be offsetting collections from the sale of physical assets (e.g. land, structures, equipment, or commodities), which should be reported as negative amounts in the correct physical asset character class code. the gross budget authority and outlays for investments and grants should be identified first and classified with the appropriate character class code (i.e., character class codes 1xxx, 2001, or 2003). for the remaining spending and offsetting collections, use character class code 2004 as a residual balancing entry to ensure that the sum of entries in schedule c add to total net budget authority and outlays in schedule a by subfunction. this means that, in appropriate cases, character class code 2004 amounts may be negative. as an example, consider an account with gross ba and outlays of $100 million that receives $20 million in offsetting collections from the public and spends all of it. if $70 million of the funds in the account are for the construction of a non-r&d federal facility (character class code 1314) and $30 million for direct federal non-investment activities (character class code 2004), then schedule c would show $70 million in gross ba and outlays on line 1314, and character class code 2004 would show a net $10 million. the net $10 million can be thought of two ways: as a residual balancing entry to ensure that total net outlays in schedule c equal total net outlays in schedule x (in this case $80 million), or as the sum of $30 million for direct federal non-investment spending, and -$20 million for collections from the public. the sum of all character class codes would add to net outlays and, in this example, would be $80 million. (c) classifying activities financed by offsetting collections from federal sources if grants to state or local governments or investments are financed by payments from one federal account to a second federal account (i.e., offsetting collections from federal sources), you must ensure that the amounts are recorded as grants or investments only once (i.e., ensure that they are not double-counted). in general, the amounts should be recorded as follows: ‚Ä¢ for all grants to state or local governments, record the grants in the second account (i.e., the account that actually makes the payment to the state or local government). record the payment from the first account to the second account as direct federal spending. ‚Ä¢ for direct federal investment (which includes all investments except those through grants to state or local governments), record the investment in the account that is primarily responsible for funding the investment. (note that grants to research institutions are classified as direct federal investment, not as grants to state or local governments.) this is usually the initial account. for example, if the environmental protection agency (epa) provides funds to the national science foundation (nsf) for research, record the r&d in the epa account that funds the research, not in nsf. in this example, the nsf spending should be coded as non-investment spending (line 2004) rather than as spending for research. however, in certain cases, primary responsibility might occur in the second account. for example, regarding rental payments to the gsa federal buildings fund, some of the rental receipts may ultimately be used for construction by gsa. in these situations, the investment omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 7 of section 84 section 84‚Äîcharacter classification (schedule c) should be recorded in the second account because primary responsibility for the investment would be in that account. (d) reporting offsetting receipts (receipt accounts) you must also report offsetting receipts for py through by by character class in schedules k (baseline) and r (policy). classify offsetting receipts in receipt accounts as federal investment to report: ‚Ä¢ proceeds from the sale of physical assets (e.g., land, structures, equipment, or commodities) in the corresponding physical asset character classes; and ‚Ä¢ credit reform offsetting receipts for downward reestimates and negative subsidies for investment-related credit programs (i.e., for physical assets or for the conduct of education and training) on the appropriate investment line number (i.e., 13xx or 1512). omb controls the character classification of offsetting receipts centrally. when setting up a new receipt account, discuss the usage of a character classification with your omb representative. and to change the classification, you must get approval before you can enter data under a different code. (see section 79.4 for proposing changes to budget account classifications.) for general guidance on reporting collections deposited in offsetting receipt accounts in schedules k and r use the instructions in section 81.3(b). (e) credit programs for credit program accounts, classify subsidies and subsidy reestimates for direct loans and loan guarantees and their administrative expenses according to the purpose of the program in schedule c and on the appropriate character class line. for example, credit subsidies for construction should be in the character class for construction and rehabilitation (131x), and credit subsidies for the conduct of education should be in the character class for the conduct of education and training (15xx). classify direct loans and loan guarantees to state or local governments on a grant line. do not report character class for credit financing accounts. (f) outyear projections agencies should enter character class data in the max budget data system for py through by. max will automatically generate outyear projections of grant outlays through by+9 based on in-year data. other entries will be shown through by only. for the projection of grant outlays max will assume, using an algorithm, that the percentage of grant outlays estimated for the outyears is the same as that reported in the by. for example, if 18 percent of outlays in the account are on line 1511‚Äì02 (grant outlays for education and training) in by, then 18 percent of net outlays will be estimated on line 1511‚Äì02 for each outyear. agencies may view these outyear projections on-screen. if projections do not accurately reflect outyear policy, contact your omb representative to request permission to override the projections in max. (g) relationships with other data requirements you should be able to reconcile information reported in this schedule for the conduct of r&d with information reported in the national science foundation\\'s survey of federal funds for r&d (see description of line 14xx), and with information provided in the supplemental r&d data request described in (h) below. r&d spending reported in schedule c should also be consistent with financial reporting on page 8 of section 84 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 84‚Äîcharacter classification (schedule c) r&d, as required by a-136 section ii.4.10 and the statement of federal financial accounting standards 8, chapter 7. you should also be able to reconcile the total reported in this schedule for the construction of r&d facilities (1311 or 1312) and major movable r&d equipment (1321 or 1322) with information reported in the national science foundation\\'s survey of federal funds for r&d as r&d plant. (h) additional research and development reporting requirements crosscutting r&d data for specific topics, such as climate change research, and nanotechnology r&d, will be requested in order to meet congressional reporting requirements. these data are collected outside of max a-11 in an online max collect tool (see section 25.5). annual reports that complement the budget data are issued by components of the national science and technology council. detailed instructions and definitions will be distributed by omb through a budget data request. 84.4 how do i report character classification in max? in schedules c, k, and r, character class data are identified by a line number that consists of a four-digit number and a two-digit suffix (xxxx‚Äìxx). the line number identifies data as investment or non-investment, and as grants or direct federal programs. character class line numbers include the following: ‚Ä¢ investment activities: ‚Ä¢ lines 13xx, physical assets. ‚Ä¢ lines 14xx, research and development (r&d). ‚Ä¢ lines 15xx, education and training. ‚Ä¢ non-investment activities: ‚Ä¢ lines 2xxx. classify all investment activities in the 1xxx series and all non-investment activities in the 2xxx series. the two-digit suffix differentiates among budget authority, outlays, and offsetting receipts, as follows: ‚Ä¢ 01‚Äîbudget authority ‚Ä¢ 02‚Äîoutlays ‚Ä¢ 03‚Äîoffsetting receipts use the guidance in section 84.2 to ensure that data are reported in the correct categories. only some of the following codes apply to offsetting receipts; they are specifically noted below with an asterisk (*). all of the line numbers apply to budget authority and outlays. for grants to state and local governments lines (odd numbered lines) make sure to select the appropriate bea category when entering a new line. use guidance in section 79.4(c) to assist. for non-grants lines max a-11 does not code amounts by bea category. also for grants to state and local governments, max a-11 will automatically calculate outlays in the outyears. no outyear data is stored in max a-11 for direct federal investment lines. you can see the previous year\\'s character class data under \"historical reports\" on the budget season reports page. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 9 of section 84 section 84‚Äîcharacter classification (schedule c) the following table lists the line numbers used to report character classification and provides a description of each line. see exhibit 84 for a summary of the coding structure. entry description 1xxx investment activities budget authority, outlays, or offsetting receipts for programs that yield benefits largely in the future. 13xx physical assets: amounts for the purchase, construction, manufacture, rehabilitation, or major improvement of physical assets regardless of whether the assets are owned or operated by the federal government, states, municipalities, or private individuals. physical assets are land, structures, equipment, and intellectual property (e.g., software or applications) that have an estimated useful life of two years or more; and commodity inventories. the cost of the asset includes both its purchase price and all other costs incurred to bring it to a form and location suitable for its use. 131x construction and rehabilitation: amounts for construction and rehabilitation, including both grants and direct federal programs. construction and rehabilitation means the design and production of fixed works and structures or substantial alterations to such structures or land. includes new works and major additions, alterations, improvements to and replacements of existing works. excludes preliminary surveys, maintenance, repair, administration of such facilities and other federal operating expenses. research and development facilities: amounts for the construction and rehabilitation of r&d facilities (see section 84.2(e) and 84.2(f) for 1311‚Äìxx grants to state and local governments further information.) 1312‚Äìxx direct federal programs other construction and rehabilitation: amounts for all other construction and rehabilitation. 1313‚Äìxx grants to state and local governments 1314‚Äìxx direct federal programs 132x major equipment: amounts for identifiable items of major equipment, including information technology (see section 55), vehicles, ships, machine tools, aircraft, tanks, satellites and other physical assets in space, and nuclear weapons. excludes routine purchases of ordinary office equipment or furniture and fixtures. however, where there are major programs for acquisition of equipment, such as ammunition and missiles, includes all equipment purchases. research and development equipment: 1321‚Äìxx grants to state and local governments 1322‚Äìxx direct federal programs other major equipment: 1323‚Äìxx grants to state and local governments 1324‚Äìxx direct federal programs page 10 of section 84 amounts for major moveable equipment for research and development.

and development objectives, key activities, and associated resources that are needed to support agency accomplishment of programmatic goals. furthermore, your budget submission should describe the specific activities and/or actions planned to meet the standards for success under human capital initiatives, the associated resources, the expected outcomes, and how performance will be measured. for example, you should: identify the organizational changes you are proposing to: ‚Ä¢ reduce the number of managers, reduce organizational layers, and reduce the time it takes to make decisions. ‚Ä¢ increase the span of control and redirect positions within the agency to ensure that the largest number of employees possible are in direct service delivery positions and retrain and/or redeploy employees as part of restructuring efforts to make the organization more citizen-centered. identify the training, development, leadership development, and staffing actions you propose to take to: ‚Ä¢ ensure continuity of leadership. ‚Ä¢ ensure that leaders and managers effectively manage people. ‚Ä¢ sustain a learning environment that drives continuous improvement in performance. ‚Ä¢ prepare for and respond to changes driven by e-government. omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 1 of section 85 section 85‚Äîestimating employment levels and the employment summary (schedule q) present agency competency and skill needs (or gaps) you identify as part of your workforce planning effort and how you plan to address those needs through recruitment, development, and related strategies. 85.2 what terms do i need to know? employee, as defined in 5 u.s.c. 2105, means an officer or individual who is appointed under a delegated authority, is engaged in the performance of a federal function, and is subject to the supervision of an officer or employee of the federal government. full-time equivalent (fte) employment means the total number of regular straight-time hours worked (i.e., not including overtime or holiday hours worked) by employees divided by the number of compensable hours applicable to each fiscal year. annual leave, sick leave, compensatory time off and other approved leave categories are considered \"hours worked\" for purposes of defining full-time equivalent employment that is reported in the employment summary (see section 85.6). a list of compensable days (with associated hours) is provided in section 85.5(c). 85.3 what should be the basis for my personnel estimates? (1) staffing requirements. base estimates for staffing requirements on the assumption that improvements in skills, organization, procedures, and supervision will produce a steady increase in productivity. personnel should be reassigned, to the maximum extent, to meet new program requirements. use personnel currently funded to the maximum extent in staffing new programs and expansions of existing programs. these actions should be part of your agency\\'s overall human capital strategy, and reflected in the integrated performance plan (see section 220). reductions generally should be planned where the workload is stable. where information technology systems are installed or enhanced, gains in productivity should result in lower personnel requirements after the first year. you should be prepared to explain the assumptions underlying staffing requirement adjustment upon request. where appropriate, use calculations converting workload to required personnel that include an estimate of available workhours per employee. you should exclude annual leave, sick leave, administrative leave, training, and other non-work time from these calculations. base estimates of available time on current data, reflect steps taken to improve the ratio of available time to total time, and recognize differences in available time by organization, location, or activity. base exclusions for annual and sick leave on current experience of actual leave taken rather than leave earned. employment levels should reflect budget proposals and assumptions with regard to workload, efficiency, proposed legislation, interagency reimbursable arrangements, and other special staffing methods. employment intended for proposed legislation, or for carrying out proposed supplemental appropriations, cannot begin until the additional funds become available by congressional action. employment proposed for activation of new facilities or start-up of new programs cannot begin until the new activity begins. employment under estimated reimbursable arrangements also cannot begin until such arrangements have been negotiated and justified. (2) personnel resources. base estimates of personnel resources on the total number of regularly scheduled straight-time hours (worked or to be worked) in the fiscal year (see section 85.5(c)). note that, although budgetary resources must be sufficient to cover any extra compensable days in a fiscal year, some of the corresponding outlays may not occur until the following year. (3) requirement for fte data. wherever entries in schedules or materials required by this circular pertain to personnel requirements or total employment levels, state such entries for all years in terms of ftes, as defined in section 85.2, unless another measure is explicitly required. for military employment, see section 85.8. page 2 of section 85 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 85‚Äîestimating employment levels and the employment summary (schedule q) 85.4 what is the requirement for reporting civilian fte data in the budget? with the exception of some national security functions, agencies will report prior fiscal year civilian fte actuals in max a-11 de schedule q each fall, along with current and budget year estimates. therefore, agencies should maintain a system of accounting for their fte on a regular basis. 85.5 what do i need to know about fte budgeted levels? (a) federal fte requirements there are no statutory or other government-wide caps on fte levels. similarly, agencies have the flexibility to manage their fte levels, within their budget constraints, and to determine how many ftes are required to successfully accomplish their mission. in exercising this authority, agencies may put into place internal management controls with respect to ftes that, among other things, help to ensure that the agency does not exceed its appropriated funding level. agencies should take steps to assess and, as appropriate, restructure, retrain, and resize its fte count to achieve its mission as effectively and efficiently as possible. such steps should be consistent with all human capital management reports. all increases in ftes should be accompanied by a detailed justification of its purpose and workload, and should be appropriately commensurate with changes in account funding levels. generally, if agency account funding requests decrease from previous years, the agency should take appropriate steps to reduce fte levels as necessary. where agencies have proposed the termination, reduction, or consolidation of a program, agencies should take the appropriate steps to reduce fte levels that correspond with the proposed program reductions. agencies should not overstate fte levels, and provide justification supporting the accuracy of fte estimates. (b) workforce conversions consistent with the general policy of making the most effective use of government resources, each agency head will ensure close management of budgeted fte levels for their agency. agencies should not convert the work of their employees to contractors unless they determine that the work is not inherently governmental (as defined in the federal activities inventory reform act of 1998, p.l. 105-270), the agency has sufficient internal capability and capacity to maintain control of its mission and operations, and the agency undertakes cost comparisons that demonstrate that such a conversion is of financial advantage to the government (see omb circular a-76). pursuant to 41 u.s.c. 1710 and 10 u.s.c. 2461, agencies are precluded from converting, in whole or in part, functions performed by federal employees to contract performance absent a public-private competition (a practice known as \"direct conversion\"). the conversion of work from in-house to private sector performance may only occur through public-private competition. appropriations acts since 2009, however, have prohibited agencies from using funds to \"begin or announce a study or public-private competition regarding the conversion to contractor performance of any function performed by federal employees pursuant to office of management and budget circular a76 or any other administrative regulation, directive, or policy.\" (c) determining fte usage you must prepare budget estimates relating to personnel requirements in terms of fte employment as specified in this circular. agencies may choose from two methods to determine current year and budget year fte employment estimates: omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 3 of section 85 section 85‚Äîestimating employment levels and the employment summary (schedule q) regular method -divide the estimated total number of regular hours by the number of compensable hours in each fiscal year. divide the total regular hours worked during the actual fiscal year (october 1-september 30) by the number of compensable hours shown in the table below for the applicable fiscal year. the regular method derives compensable days by counting days in the standard monday-through-friday workweek in the given fiscal year. compensable hours are derived by multiplying the number of compensable days by 8 hours (i.e., the standard workday). pay period method -divide regular hours worked during a period of 26 biweekly pay periods (closely corresponding to the fiscal year) are by 2080 hours. (the 26 biweekly pay periods cover 52 weeks with 40 hours in a standard workweek. 52 x 40 = 2080.) the 26 biweekly pay periods that closely correspond to a fiscal year are identified as the pay periods that end in the given fiscal year. if there are 27 pay periods that end in a fiscal year, agencies should drop the one implicating the fewest work days in that fiscal year, so that 26 pay periods are always used. fte employment levels apply to straight-time hours only. include foreign national direct hire employees in your fte employment totals. ftes funded by allocations from other agencies will be included with the performing agency where the employees work and are paid (see section 85.7). be sure to include in fte employment estimates for all federal employees, including persons appointed under the worker trainee opportunity program, presidential management fellows, federal cooperative education program, summer aids, stay-in-school program, and the federal junior fellowship program. compensable days and hours for current and future fiscal years using regular method fiscal year days hours 2019 2020 2021 261 262 261 2,088 2,096 2,088 (d) justification and estimates of fte usage the fte estimates for each agency are determined at the time of the annual budget review, for the fiscal year in progress and for the succeeding fiscal year. in addition, you must ensure that the fte estimates are consistent with all applicable laws. in particular, some statutes providing agencies with authority to use voluntary separation incentive proposals (or \"buy-outs\") stipulate that agency-wide fte levels must be reduced one-for-one for each buy-out. further, fte estimates must represent an effective and efficient use of resources to meet program requirements. current year fte estimates should be consistent with py actuals, should be fully funded, and should be very close to the actual usage reported at the end of the fiscal year. for example, the estimates in the previous budget should be very close to the actuals published in the current budget. (e) fte transfers between agencies prior to entering into new or expanded agreements to perform work for other agencies on a reimbursable basis, you must prepare a cost justification. as part of this agreement, you may transfer ftes on a one-forone basis, provided that you notify omb prior to making such a transfer. you may proceed with the fte transfer fifteen days after notification to omb, unless omb objects. page 4 of section 85 omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) section 85‚Äîestimating employment levels and the employment summary (schedule q) (f) adjustment requests send all requests for adjustments in employment levels, including agreements to transfer ftes between agencies, to your omb representative. 85.6 what do i need to know about the employment summary (schedule q)? this schedule shows the total full-time equivalent (fte) civilian employment of straight-time compensable workyears (i.e., not overtime) financed by an account for py through by. fte employment excludes estimates for terminal leave and overtime hours. the method for calculating fte employment is described in section 85.5. you must provide an employment summary when an account contains an entry for either direct or reimbursable personnel compensation in the object class schedule (i.e., object class entry 11.1 or 11.3 (see section 83.7)). you must also provide an employment summary when employees are compensated via an allocation account. for reimbursable and allocation fte arrangements, see the discussion on their budget schedule treatment in section 85.7. this schedule also shows military average strength employment as discussed in section 85.9. the definition of object class 11.1 stipulates that compensation must be included for all workdays in the fiscal year. you must ensure that fte levels in the employment summary and funding for ftes in the object class schedule are reported consistently. you must also ensure that agency-wide fte totals agree with the negotiated levels in the current and budget years. prior year fte in the employment summary must equal your agency\\'s fte execution level. when entering fte data in schedule q, use the four-digit line numbering scheme described in the following table: employment summary (schedule q) entry description xxxx the first digit of the line number distinguishes between direct, reimbursable, and other categories, consistent with the reporting of data in the object classification schedule (see section 83.5). use the following codes: 1‚Äîdirect 2‚Äîreimbursable 3‚Äîallocation account xxxx the second digit of the line number distinguishes between civilian and military employment. use the following codes: 0‚Äîcivilian employment 1‚Äîmilitary employment xx0x the third digit is 0. xxx1 the fourth digit is 1. 85.7 are allocation and reimbursable fte presented differently in the budget appendix? omb circular no. a‚Äì11 (2019) page 5 of section 85 section 85‚Äîestimating employment levels and the employment summary (schedule q) yes, fte financed by allocation and reimb'"
